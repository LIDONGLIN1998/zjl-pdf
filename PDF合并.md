BACKGROUND

Whether surgical repair of an acute Achilles’ tendon rupture by an open-repair or 

minimally invasive approach is associated with better outcomes than nonsurgical 

treatment is not clear.

METHODS

We performed a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial that compared non￾operative treatment, open repair, and minimally invasive surgery in adults with 

acute Achilles’ tendon rupture who presented to four trial centers. The primary 

outcome was the change from baseline in the Achilles’ tendon Total Rupture Score 

(scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better health status) at 

12 months. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of tendon rerupture.

RESULTS

A total of 554 patients underwent randomization, and 526 patients were in￾cluded in the final analysis. The mean changes in the Achilles’ tendon Total 

Rupture Score were −17.0 points in the nonoperative group, −16.0 points in the 

open-repair group, and −14.7 points in the minimally invasive surgery group 

(P=0.57). Pairwise comparisons provided no evidence of differences between 

the groups. The changes from baseline in physical performance and patient￾reported physical function were similar in the three groups. The number of 

tendon reruptures was higher in the nonoperative group (6.2%) than in the open￾repair or minimally invasive surgery group (0.6% in each). There were 9 nerve 

injuries in the minimally invasive surgery group (in 5.2% of the patients) as 

compared with 5 in the open-repair group (in 2.8%) and 1 in the nonoperative 

group (in 0.6%).

CONCLUSIONS

In patients with Achilles’ tendon rupture, surgery (open repair or minimally inva￾sive surgery) was not associated with better outcomes than nonoperative treatment 

at 12 months. (Funded by the South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority

An acute Achilles’ tendon rupture 

is one of the most common musculo￾skeletal injuries, with an annual inci￾dence of 5 to 50 events per 100,000 persons, and 

may result in severe disability.1-3 This injury is 

more common with older age, more active life￾styles, and male sex,4

 and has been increasing in 

incidence over the past few decades.5

Randomized, controlled trials that have com￾pared nonoperative treatment with open repair 

of acute Achilles’ tendon rupture have shown 

similar patient-reported outcomes and physical 

performance with both approaches.6,7 A recent 

systematic review of 10 randomized, controlled 

trials (involving 944 patients) and 19 observa￾tional studies (involving 14,918 patients) showed 

a higher risk of rerupture after nonoperative 

treatment, whereas surgical treatment was as￾sociated with the risks of postoperative compli￾cations such as infections and nerve injuries.8

However, the trials that were reviewed were 

generally small, and treatment and rehabilitation 

protocols varied or, in some cases, were incom￾pletely described. Several studies have suggested 

that accelerated functional rehabilitation pro￾tocols that emphasize early mobilization and 

weight-bearing may lessen the risk of rerupture 

after nonoperative treatment,9,10 but these find￾ings are inconsistent.11,12 Minimally invasive sur￾gical techniques have been developed to reduce 

the risk of complications associated with open 

surgical repair,13 but randomized, controlled 

trials that have compared nonoperative treat￾ment, open repair, and minimally invasive sur￾gery are few in number and involved limited 

sample sizes.14-17 To better inform clinical deci￾sion making with regard to acute Achilles’ tendon 

rupture, we conducted a multicenter, random￾ized trial to compare nonoperative treatment, 

open repair, and minimally invasive surgery.

Methods

Trial Design and Oversight

We conducted this three-group, randomized, 

controlled trial at four centers. Full details of the 

trial design, conduct, oversight, and analyses are 

provided in the protocol and statistical analysis 

plan, available with the full text of this article at 

NEJM.org. The trial was approved by the institu￾tional review board at each center and the Re￾gional Committee for Medical and Health Re￾search Ethics South East Norway. The first, last, 

and two other authors vouch for the accuracy 

and completeness of the data and for the fidelity 

of the trial to the protocol.

Patients

Patients were assessed for eligibility if they were 

18 to 60 years of age and had presented with an 

Achilles’ tendon rupture at a participating cen￾ter. Patients had to be fluent in Norwegian to 

complete the questionnaires. Exclusion criteria 

were a previous Achilles’ tendon rupture, the 

American Society of Anesthesiologists physical 

status classification higher than II (on a scale of 

I to VI, with higher classes indicating more se￾vere systemic disease), the receipt of quinolones 

or local glucocorticoid injections (in the area of 

the Achilles’ tendon) in the 6 months before the 

injury, dependence on walking aids, and other 

disabilities related to walking.18-21

Trial Procedures

Eligible patients were randomly assigned, in a 

1:1:1 ratio, to receive nonoperative treatment or 

to undergo open repair or minimally invasive 

surgery. Randomization was stratified according 

to trial center, with random block sizes of 6, 9, 

and 12. We used Random Allocation Software, 

version 1.0 (Microsoft), to perform randomiza￾tion22; the investigators were unaware of the 

group assignments.

The two surgical procedures are described in 

detail in Section S2.1 of the Supplementary Ap￾pendix (available at NEJM.org).23,24 Participating 

surgeons were required to have performed at 

least one open repair and one minimally invasive 

surgical procedure before participating in the 

trial. Patients did not receive antibiotic prophy￾laxis.25 A below-the-knee equinus cast (with 

plantar flexion) was applied within 72 hours 

after the injury regardless of the treatment 

group assignment (Fig. S1). The cast was main￾tained for 2 weeks after application in the non￾operative group; in the surgical groups, a new 

cast was applied after surgery and maintained 

for 2 weeks. For 6 weeks after the cast was re￾moved, patients were allowed to bear weight on 

the injured foot as tolerated using an ankle–foot 

orthosis with heel wedges. The number of heel 

wedges was gradually reduced from three in the 

first week of orthosis treatment to none in the 

last week. All the participants followed a stan￾A Quick Take

dardized rehabilitation protocol (Section S2.2). 

Participants wore knee-high socks to mask po￾tential surgical scars at the 6- and 12-month 

physical assessments. Additional information 

pertaining to the interventions, rehabilitation, 

follow-ups, and testing procedures is provided in 

Sections S2.1 through S2.4.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the change from 

baseline in the Achilles’ tendon Total Rupture 

Score at the 12-month follow-up. The Achilles’ 

tendon Total Rupture Score is a patient-reported 

assessment designed to measure outcomes in 

patients treated for acute Achilles’ tendon rup￾ture. The questionnaire consists of 10 questions 

to assess symptoms and the level of physical 

activity; answers are assessed on an 11-point 

Likert scale (scores range from 0 to 10, with a 

maximum possible score of 100; higher scores 

represent better health status). The minimal 

clinically important difference in the score has 

previously been defined as 8 to 10 points,12,26,27

and the minimal detectable change, which 

represents the smallest change detectable be￾yond measurement error, has been reported to 

be 7 points.32,33

Secondary outcomes included the change 

from baseline in the Achilles’ tendon Total Rup￾ture Score at the 3- and 6-month follow-ups; the 

change from baseline in the subscore for physi￾cal functioning, the physical component sum￾mary, and the mental component summary on 

the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) at 

the 6- and 12-month follow-ups; physical perfor￾mance at the 6- and 12-month follow-ups; and 

the incidence of tendon rerupture at the 12-month 

follow-up. The SF-36 evaluates general health￾related quality of life on the basis of patients’ 

responses to 36 questions sorted into eight 

multi-item subscales. Scores on each subscale 

range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicat￾ing better health status.28 The eight subscales all 

contribute to the physical component summary 

and the mental component summary. The phys￾ical component summary emphasizes physical 

function, pain, and general health, and the men￾tal component summary focuses on social func￾tioning, mental health, and emotional well￾being. We generated baseline scores for the 

Achilles’ tendon Total Rupture Score and SF-36 

retrospectively by instructing the patients to 

answer the questionnaires at the time of enroll￾ment (after the application of the equinus cast 

but before randomization) according to their 

preinjury status. The validity and reliability of 

the Norwegian translations of the Achilles’ ten￾don Total Rupture Score and SF-36 have previ￾ously been assessed, and construct validity for 

both questionnaires is supported by Spearman’s 

correlation coefficients of more than 0.7.29,30

We tested physical performance using the 

MuscleLab measurement system (Ergotest Inno￾vation), which consists of two different jump 

tests, two different strength tests, and one mus￾cular endurance test.31 Six different measure￾ments were derived from the five physical per￾formance tests (supplementary section S2.4) and 

presented as a limb-symmetry index represent￾ing the ratio of the test result for the injured foot 

to the result for the uninjured foot, multiplied by 

100 (with a score of 100 indicating that the 

physical performance of the injured foot is equal 

to that of the uninjured foot).

Statistical Analysis

We calculated that a sample of 480 patients (160 

in each group) would be needed to provide the 

trial with 80% power, at a two-sided test with a 

5% significance level, to detect a difference of 

7 points in the Achilles’ tendon Total Rupture 

Score.32,33 To compensate for patients who were 

prematurely withdrawn from the trial or lost to 

follow-up, we targeted an enrollment of 530 

patients. Questionnaires for the Achilles’ tendon 

Total Rupture Score and the SF-36 that were 

completed up to 2.2 years postinjury were in￾cluded in the analysis to increase the number of 

responses. The late responses were accepted 

because improvements in the Achilles’ tendon 

Total Rupture Score and physical performance 

after 1 year postinjury are minimal34; thus, long￾term scores would not substantially differ from 

the primary outcome at 12 months.

We assessed the change from baseline in the 

Achilles’ tendon Total Rupture Score using a 

mixed-model analysis. The treatment group, in￾teraction of the treatment group and trial visit, 

the trial center (as a stratification factor), and 

the score at baseline were included as fixed fac￾tors. To account for dependent variables in the 

repeated measures, we included a patient-specific 

random intercept, and an unstructured correla￾tion structure was assumed for the repeated

measures. Using this model, we estimated mar￾ginal means for each trial visit and treatment 

group.

We used hierarchical testing to control the 

overall type I error. A primary omnibus test was 

conducted with the primary null hypothesis de￾fined as no differences among the three treat￾ment groups at the 12-month follow-up. If there 

were no significant differences among the three 

treatment groups, additional pairwise testing 

was conducted without significance testing. The 

absolute between-group differences and 95% 

confidence intervals are presented for these 

analyses; the 95% confidence intervals were not 

adjusted for multiplicity, and definitive treat￾ment effects cannot be inferred from these data.

The primary efficacy analyses were performed 

according to the intention-to-treat principle and 

included the full analysis population, which in￾cluded all the patients who underwent random￾ization, received treatment, and had at least one 

complete follow-up questionnaire for the Achil￾les’ tendon Total Rupture Score. If one or more 

responses were missing on a questionnaire, the 

score was considered to be missing for that 

visit.35 Missing questionnaires at baseline for 

patients were imputed with the use of median 

imputation. The remaining missingness of data 

was handled with the use of mixed modeling.

Sensitivity analyses were performed accord￾ing to the intervention that was received (per￾protocol population) and in the population of 

patients who completed all questionnaires. We 

also performed analyses to assess the sensitivity 

of the imputation of data for any Achilles’ ten￾don Total Rupture Score questionnaires missing 

at baseline and scores that were reinverted ow￾ing to indications that patients may have inverted 

the scale when answering the questionnaires. 

Details of the analyses are provided in the statis￾tical analysis plan. We conducted a post hoc 

sensitivity analysis by excluding the 12-month 

questionnaires for the Achilles’ tendon Total 

Rupture Score that were answered before 11 

months or after 13 months.

We analyzed data from the SF-36 question￾naire according to the intention-to-treat princi￾ple for all patients who had at least one non￾missing follow-up assessment that included both 

the Achilles’ tendon Total Rupture Score and 

SF-36 questionnaires. SF-36 values that were 

missing at baseline were imputed with the use of 

mean imputation. The change in SF-36 score 

from baseline was analyzed similarly to the pri￾mary outcome with the use of a linear mixed 

model. SF-36 scores were treated as missing as 

specified in the SF-36 scoring instructions. 

Missing SF-36 scores at the two follow-up visits 

were handled with the use of mixed modeling.

At the 6- and 12-month follow-ups, we ana￾lyzed the physical test results using linear re￾gression models, with adjustment for the treat￾ment variable according to the trial center. 

Missing data were handled with a combination 

of threshold and multiple imputation; details are 

provided in the statistical analysis plan.

Adverse events were registered until trial clo￾sure for all participants. For reruptures, the 

pairwise risk difference between the treatment 

groups and their 95% confidence intervals (un￾adjusted for multiplicity) were calculated with 

the use of the Newcombe hybrid score.

Results

Patients

Patients were enrolled from February 2013 

through May 2018, and the 12-month follow-up 

was concluded in May 2019. A total of 1084 pa￾tients were excluded before undergoing random￾ization for reasons listed in Figure 1 and Table 

S7. Of the 554 patients who underwent random￾ization, 22 patients were excluded before receiv￾ing treatment or before analysis (Fig. 1). Of the 

remaining 532 patients, 526 (98.9%) had at least 

one follow-up Achilles’ tendon Total Rupture 

Score and hence constituted the full analysis 

population, and 492 patients (92.5%) completed 

the questionnaire for the 12-month Achilles’ 

tendon Total Rupture Score. Table S8 shows the 

distribution of patients among the trial sites.

The characteristics of the three groups at 

baseline were similar across the trial groups 

Figure 1 (facing page). Screening, Randomization, 

Treatment, and Follow-up.

Patients who received treatment and had at least one 

follow-up Achilles’ tendon Total Rupture Score (ATRS) 

were included in the full analysis population. The data 

were analyzed according to the treatment groups that 

the patients were originally assigned to. One patient 

who had been assigned to undergo a minimally inva￾sive procedure instead underwent open repair owing 

to intraoperative technical difficulties.

trial participants was representative of the Nor￾wegian population (Table S9). Details regarding 

the number of participating surgeons, their ex￾perience, and the types of anesthesia that were 

used are provided in Tables S10 through S12. 

The median time from injury to completion of 

the final questionnaire was 1.1 years, and the 

mean was 1.2 years (range, 0.9 to 2.2) (Fig. S2).

Primary and Secondary Outcomes

The change in the Achilles’ tendon Total Rup￾ture Score from baseline to the 12-month follow￾up was −17.0 points (95% confidence interval 

[CI], −20.0 to −14.0) in the nonoperative group, 

−16.0 points (95% CI, −19.0 to −12.9) in the 

open-repair group, and −14.7 points (95% CI, 

−17.9 to −11.6) in the minimally invasive surgery 

group (P=0.57) (Table 2 and Fig. S3). Pairwise 

differences in the mean change in scores were 

1.0 point (95% CI, −5.2 to 3.1) for nonoperative 

treatment as compared with open repair, −2.6 

points (95% CI, −6.5 to 2.0) for nonoperative 

treatment as compared with minimally invasive 

surgery, and −1.2 points (95% CI, −5.5 to 3.0) for 

open repair as compared with minimally inva￾sive surgery (Tables S13 and S14). Results were 

similar in the various sensitivity analyses in 

which missing data were handled by different 

imputation techniques and questionnaire scores 

were reinverted (owing to the likelihood that 

patients inverted the scale when completing the 

questionnaires). A post hoc analysis that ex￾cluded the Achilles’ tendon Total Rupture Score 

questionnaires that were answered before 11 

months postinjury or after 13 months postinjury 

also yielded results similar to those of the pri￾mary analysis (Tables S1 through S6). Likewise, 

there were no apparent differences among the 

groups in the changes in the Achilles’ tendon 

Total Rupture Score at 3 months and 6 months 

or in the SF-36 physical functioning score or in

at 6 months and 12 months (Table 2 and Fig. S3) 

or when mean scores (instead of the changes 

from baseline) from any of the follow-up assess￾ments were used (Table S15).

At least one valid test that assessed physical 

performance was available at the 6-month fol￾low-up for 424 patients and at the 12-month 

follow-up for 363 patients. There were no mate￾rial differences among the groups in any of the 

six limb-symmetry–index measurements (Tables 

3, S16, and S17 and Fig. S4).

Safety

Serious adverse events occurred in similar per￾centages of patients in the three groups (Tables 

4 and S18). There were 11 reruptures in the non￾operative group (in 6.2% of the patients), 1 in 

the open-repair group (in 0.6%), and 1 in the 

minimally invasive surgery group (in 0.6%); no 

patient had more than 1 rerupture. The risk of 

rerupture was 5.6 percentage points higher in 

the nonoperative group than in the open-repair 

group (95% CI, 1.9 to 10.2) and the minimally 

invasive surgery group (95% CI, 1.8 to 10.2). The 

risk of rerupture was similar in the two surgical 

groups (difference in risk, −0.01 percentage 

points; 95% CI, −2.7 to 2.6). Half the reruptures 

occurred within the first 10 weeks (range, 2 to 

28) after injury (Fig. S6). There were 9 nerve in￾juries in the minimally invasive surgery group 

(in 5.2% of the patients) as compared with 5 in 

the open-repair group (in 2.8%) and 1 in the 

nonoperative group (in 0.6%). The incidence of 

other adverse events was similar among the 

groups.

Discussion

In a multicenter trial involving patients with 

acute Achilles’ tendon rupture, we found no sig￾nificant differences in changes in the Achilles’ 

tendon Total Rupture Score among patients who 

had been randomly assigned to receive non￾operative treatment or undergo open repair or 

minimally invasive surgery. There were also no 

appreciable differences among the groups in the 

secondary outcomes. The risk of rerupture was 

higher with nonoperative treatment than with 

either of the operative treatments.

Our findings are similar to those reported in 

randomized trials that showed no significant 

differences between nonoperative and surgical 

treatment of acute Achilles’ tendon rupture.6,7

However, previous trials were smaller than our 

trial and were not powered to detect differences 

as small as the minimal detectable change in the 

Achilles’ tendon Total Rupture Score. Also, un￾like previous trials, the present trial compared 

nonoperative treatment with minimally invasive 

surgery and open repair with the use of validated 

patient-reported outcome measures.8,14-17

Unlike some other trials,9,36,37 this trial 

showed a lower risk of rerupture in the surgical 

groups than in the nonoperative group. The in￾consistent results could be explained by the 

larger sample size in the present trial, since a 

meta-analysis that pooled data from 10 random￾ized, controlled trials and 19 observational stud￾ies yielded results similar to those in the present 

trial.8

 Studies have suggested that early, con￾trolled weight-bearing carries less risk of rerup￾ture than deferred weight-bearing among pa￾tients who undergo nonoperative treatment.9,10,36

However, two randomized trials that compared 

early, controlled weight-bearing with immobili￾zation for the first 6 to 8 weeks did not show 

significant differences in the risk of rerup￾ture.12,38 Nevertheless, the incidence of rerupture 

was low regardless of treatment strategy, and 

absolute differences were small.

The risk of rerupture in the surgical groups 

was lower than the risks reported in some other 

trials.8

 One possible explanation is the use of a 

modified Krackow suture technique in the open￾repair group in this trial, which may have pro￾vided a stronger repair.24 Surgeons also used 

three sutures instead of two sutures in the 

minimally invasive surgery group, although 

there is no direct evidence indicating that this 

technique increases biomechanical strength.23,39

Our trial has some limitations. For feasibility 

reasons, patients were not unaware of their as￾signed intervention. We collected baseline mea￾sures of health status retrospectively, after 

patients underwent casting but before they 

underwent randomization to treatment. However, 

because patients were unaware of treatment￾group assignment at the time of health data 

collection, the misclassification of baseline sta￾tus would be expected to be random with re￾spect to treatment group.40 In addition, some 

patients completed the 12-month questionnaires 

more than 12 months after the injury; however,

The new england journal o f medicine

changes in the Achilles’ tendon Total Rupture 

Score and in the physical performance more 

than 1 year after the time of tendon rupture have 

been reported to be minor,34 and results of a 

post hoc sensitivity analysis that involved only 

patients who responded to questionnaires at 12 

months yielded results similar to those of the 

primary analysis. Although physiotherapists who 

performed physical tests were unaware of treat￾ment-group assignments, patients were not un￾aware of their assignments, nor were the physi￾cians who conducted follow-up visits or the 

physiotherapists involved in rehabilitation; thus, 

bias is possible in patient self-reporting of out￾comes or in the implementation of accelerated 

functional rehabilitation. A careful physical ex￾amination was performed preoperatively in the 

surgical groups and resulted in the exclusion of 

two patients in the open-repair group and one 

patient in the minimally invasive surgery group 

owing to identification of gastrocnemius muscle 

rupture (rather than Achilles’ tendon rupture). 

Since patients in the nonoperative group did not 

undergo a similar evaluation before their treat￾ment, it is possible that some patients with a 

muscle rupture (and not an Achilles’ tendon rup￾ture) were included in the nonoperative group; 

however, the number of such patients, if any, 

would be expected to be small and unlikely to 

affect the overall results.

Open repair or minimally invasive surgery in 

patients with acute Achilles’ tendon rupture did 

not improve Achilles’ tendon Total Rupture 

Scores at 12 months as compared with nonoper￾ative treatment. Nonoperative treatment was 

associated with a higher risk of rerupture than 

surgical treatment but resulted in fewer nerve 

injuries than with minimally invasive surgery.

Abstract

Purpose The current rehabilitation for patients with surgically treated displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures (DIACFs) 

consists of non-weightbearing for 8–12 weeks. The purpose of the present survey was to investigate the current pre-, peri- and 

post-operative practices among Dutch foot and ankle surgeons. Moreover, it aims to analyze whether surgeons comply to the 

Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Osteosynthesefragen (AO) guidelines and which decision criteria were used in the determination 

of the start of weightbearing.

Methods A survey was distributed among Dutch trauma and orthopaedic surgeons to determine the most common practices 

in postoperative weightbearing in patients with DIACFs.

Results 75 surgeons responded to the survey. 33% of the respondents adhered to the AO guidelines. 4% of the respondents 

strictly followed non-weightbearing guidelines, while 96% interpret the AO guidelines or their local protocol freely, in any 

frequency. When respondents tended to deviate from the AO guidelines or local protocol, a good patients’ compliance to 

therapy was expected. 83% of the respondents started weightbearing on the fracture, based on reported patient complaints. 

87% of the respondents did not see any relation between early weightbearing and the occurrence of complications, including 

loosening of osteosynthesis materials.

Conclusion This study demonstrates that there is limited consensus on the rehabilitation for DIACFs. Moreover, it shows 

that most surgeons are inclined to interpret the current (AO) guideline or their own local protocol freely. New guidelines, 

supported with well-founded literature, could help surgeons in a more appropriate daily practice in weightbearing for the 

rehabilitation of calcaneal fractures.

Introduction

The annual incidence of calcaneal fractures is approxi￾mately 11.5 per 100,000 patients and occurs 2.4 times 

more frequently in males comparing to females [1]. Opera￾tive treatment is often needed in case of displaced intraar￾ticular calcaneal fractures (DIACFs), which are generally 

classified by the Sanders classification [2]. Even after suc￾cessful operative treatment, long rehabilitation is required 

with major impact on activities of daily living, quality of 

life and socio-economic aspects [3, 4]. Anatomic surgical 

restoration does not prevent gait disturbances or persistent 

foot pain, yet it is thought to optimize functional outcome 

[5].

The last few decades new surgical techniques have been 

developed to improve functional outcomes. Percutaneous 

techniques (PT) (i.e., Forgon and Zadravecz) have been 

proposed to aim at lowering soft tissue compromise and 

improving overall outcomes [6, 7]. While the Extensile 

Lateral Approach (ELA), remains the most widely used 

approach, the Sinus Tarsi Approach (STA) is gaining 

ground [8].

According to the Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Osteosyn￾thesefragen (German: “working group for bone fusion 

issues”) Principles of Fracture Management (‘AO guide￾lines’), the current aftercare protocol for patients with 

DIACFs consists of 8 to 12 weeks of non-weightbearing 

(NWB) followed by partial weightbearing with a weekly 

increase of 25% in weight loading [9]. These guidelines 

have been the standard for decades, even though the posi￾tive effects of early weightbearing on fracture healing and 

maintaining muscles and bone mass are well known [10]. 

Therefore, it can be questioned if the guidelines should be 

interpreted more broadly.

The purpose of this survey is to investigate pre-, peri￾and post-operative practices among Dutch trauma and 

orthopaedic surgeons, regarding patients with DIACFs. 

Moreover, it aims to analyze whether surgeons comply 

to the current non-weight bearing guidelines and which 

criteria were used to decide when and at what level to start 

weightbearing after surgically treated DIACFs.

Materials and methods

A web-based survey was developed using online software 

(http://www.surveymonkey.nl) and was distributed among 

Dutch trauma and orthopaedic surgeons.

All hospitals in the Netherlands were contacted 

directly through phone and e-mail in the period of May 

2021 to October 2021 to find out whom of the trauma 

and orthopaedic surgeons are involved in lower extremity 

fracture management. The survey was published in the 

newsletter of the Dutch Trauma Society (NVT) and was 

posted as a news item on their website. Finally, the survey 

was brought under attention by distributing flyers at the 

Dutch trauma congress (‘Traumadagen’) in 2021. The sur￾vey consists of 23 multiple choice and 7 open questions as 

shown in Supplementary Information 1, a summary of the 

survey is shown in Table 1. The NVT has 597 members, of 

which it was estimated that around 130 surgeons are regu￾larly involved in treating calcaneal fractures surgically.

Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Sta￾tistics, Version 28.0, Armonk, NY. Descriptive statistics 

were used to describe the demographic data and baseline 

characteristics of the entire survey. Results are presented as 

mean±standard deviation (SD) or as frequencies and per￾centages, unless indicated otherwise.

Results

A total of 75 surgeons responded to the survey. 54 (72%) 

were trauma surgeons and 19 (25%) were orthopaedic sur￾geons. Two respondents (3%) were residents.

All respondents were active as surgeons with a mean 

experience time in treating calcaneal fractures of 14.1 years. 

44% of the respondents did an additional fellowship in foot 

and ankle surgery. 23 respondents (31%) worked in a level-I, 

39 respondents (52%) in a level-II and 13 respondents (17%) 

in a level-III trauma center [11].

30 respondents (40%) indicated that their center treated 

less than 10 fractures operatively, in 42 centers (56%) 11–40 

fractures were operatively treated, and in 3 centers (4%) 

more than 40 calcaneal fractures were treated operatively 

per year, as shown Fig. 1.

Preoperative assessment (n=75)

Most of the respondents classified calcaneal fractures by 

evaluating the subtalar joint (fracture gap and step-off) on 

a CT-scan (84%). 71% did so by using the Sanders classi￾fication [2]. One respondent used the Zwipp classification, 

26% of the surgeons used the Essex-Lopresti classification 

[12, 13].

9 out of 10 respondents preferred to treat non-displaced 

fractures (Sanders type I) conservatively. 61% to 77% of the 

respondents were very likely to treat a Sanders type II or III 

fracture by using ELA or STA. STA was more preferred than 

the ELA. Between 13 and 23% were very likely to consider 

the use of PT.

The treatment of Sanders type IV calcaneal fractures 

showed the most variation in the preferred treatment. 34% 

of the respondents inclined towards the use of the ELA as 

treatment of choice. To a lesser extent the STA (20%), con￾servative treatment (16%), primary arthrodesis (16%) and 

PT (14%) were chosen.

According to the respondents the ideal time from trauma 

to surgery (TTS) would be 9–10 days. The self-estimated 

mean TTS was 9.9 days.

Perioperative assessment (n=31)

Independent of the type of surgery or fracture, almost 

66% of the respondents used one fluoroscope, 16% of the 

respondents used two. Another 16% used a 3D technique. 

All respondents provided their patients preoperative antibi￾otic prophylaxis.

Almost all respondents (94%) considered a congruent 

subtalar joint or a congruent angle of Böhler (87%) as a 

marker for successful reposition [14]. Approximately half of 

them (48%) applied the difference in pre- and postoperative 

angle of Gissane to describe the reduction [13].

Postoperative assessment (n=31)

The estimated mean postoperative hospital admission time 

was 2.2 days. Generally, 33% of the respondents adhered 

to the current non-weight bearing guidelines (8–12 weeks 

NWB). 47% of the respondents started weightbearing after 

wound healing. 4% of the surgeons strictly followed their 

local (non-weightbearing) guidelines, while 96% of the 

respondents interpret their local protocol more freely, in 

any frequency. If so, a presumed good patients’ compliance 

to therapy is expected by 73% of the respondents, shown in 

Fig. 2.

83% starts weightbearing with increasing the actual load 

weekly, based on reported patient complaints. As shown in 

Fig. 3, full weightbearing (FWB) was described as walk￾ing without crutches or walking with one crutch, but with 

FWB on the affected side by 83%. 13% described FWB as 

the ability to stand on the affected side. 87% reported not 

to see any relation between early weightbearing and the 

occurrence of complications, including loosening of osteo￾synthesis materials. All respondents requested their patients 

to return to the outpatient clinic for the first check-up, two 

weeks postoperatively.

Figure 4 shows that respondents expect the ELA to be 

most likely to cause complications (19%). While STA and 

PT are thought to be the cause of complications in 9% and 

5%.

Discussion

The current study investigated the current state of pre-, 

peri- and postoperative practice of calcaneal fractures 

and the start of aftercare involving weightbearing among 

Dutch (orthopaedic) trauma surgeons, specialized in foot￾and ankle fracture management.

Preoperative assessment

This study illustrated a consensus on the preferred TTS. 

The desired TTS in this study is comparable to inter￾national literature [15]. Nevertheless, the ideal TTS 

for DIACFs remains a debate in many studies [16–18]. 

Although no golden standard exists, to prevent soft tissue 

complications, the ‘wrinkle test’ is performed to determine 

the decrease of swelling.

Although in recent literature it was stated that radio￾logical measurements should not be considered to be guid￾ance in the postoperative period, this study shows that the 

Sanders classification and evaluation of the subtalar joint 

are mostly used as methods to classify DIACFs. Literature 

confirms the popularity of the Sanders classification as the 

most well-known and used system for describing DIACFs 

[19, 20].

Two-third of the foot and ankle surgeons in this study 

consider ORIF as preferred technique in treating Sanders 

type II fractures. There was a mild preference for STA 

over ELA. In 2008, a study conducted by Schepers et al. 

showed that the majority of the patients were treated with 

ORIF (i.e., ELA and STA 46%), conservatively (39%) or 

with percutaneous screw fixation (10%) [21]. In contrast 

to our survey, the study by Schepers et al. did not differ￾entiate between more or less severely dislocated fractures 

by using the Sanders classification. A recent systematic 

review concluded that STA may be the preferred approach 

in the operative treatment of patients with displaced Sand￾ers type II and III DIACFs in order to reduce wound heal￾ing complications, time-to-surgery and operative time and 

shows a similar restoration of calcaneal anatomy [15]. 

Although better clinical outcomes favoring STA seem to 

be achieved, recent literature showed no significant differ￾ence in the cost-effectiveness of ELA versus STA (ELA 

$8766.8 ± 2835.2/QALY, STA $7914.9 ± 1822.0/QALY 

respectively) [22].

Between 13 and 23% of the surgeons would consider PT 

as preferred technique in treating Sanders type II and III. 

Another 13% would consider PT for Sanders type IV. This 

is a rise in numbers, compared to a national survey per￾formed by Schepers et al. in 2008 (10%), however, in that 

study no differentiation in Sanders type was made [21]. 

Although these numbers are rising in the Netherlands, PT 

might be undervalued. A recent study from colleagues of 

our research group comparing ELA and PT in DIACFs 

with a follow-up of 20 years, showed similarity in restor￾ing Böhlers angle, with similar functional outcomes [23].

Three decades ago, Sanders et al. suggested that primary 

subtalar arthrodesis (PSTA) has advantages in treating 

patients with DIACFs, type IV [24]. Since then, PSTA has 

been the golden standard. However, a recent, randomized 

multicenter trial showed no significant difference in the 

treatment of type IV fractures between ORIF and ORIF 

combined with PSTA [4]. The results in this survey show 

that surgeons in the Netherlands are indecisive as it comes 

to the treatment of Sanders type IV. Only a minority of 

respondents choses for PSTA as treatment of choice.

Perioperative assessment

This study showed that almost all surgeons use fluoroscopy 

during the operation, while 32% of the surgeons used a 3D 

evaluation technique. The effect of a 3D technique remains 

unclear as in recent literature it was stated that there is no 

benefit for the use of intraoperative 3D fluoroscopy with 

regard to postoperative complications, quality of life, func￾tional outcome, or posttraumatic osteoarthritis [25]. Yet, the 

use of the 3D technique leads to a significant increase of 

18% in operative time [25].

Postoperative assessment

Our survey showed that 90% of the respondents does not 

think there is an association between early weightbearing 

and the occurrence of complications. The estimated com￾plication rate for the ELA is in line with a retrospective case 

series, that found wound infection rate of 25% [26]. The 

estimated complication rate for the STA corresponds well 

to a review with a complication rate of 9% [27]. For PT the 

estimated complication rate was 5% and is not comparable to 

literature, however heterogeneity in definitions of complica￾tions make it difficult to compare the results [28].

Secondly, this study aimed to illustrate the compliance to 

the current non-weight bearing guidelines or the local proto￾col. For more than fifty years, the AO advises 8 to 12 weeks 

NWB for the aftercare of patients with DIACFs [9]. It is gen￾erally assumed that trauma and orthopedic surgeons instruct 

patients restricted weightbearing during rehabilitation. How￾ever, the results from our survey show that a large group of 

surgeons in the Netherlands is inclined to start weightbear￾ing earlier than the proposed 8 to 12 weeks. When choosing 

for earlier weightbearing, surgeons are likely to increase the 

loading on the injured foot step-by-step, based on complaints 

of the patient. It seems to be that the paradigm is chang￾ing, as a the survey from Schepers et al. fifteen years ago, 

214 European Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery & Traumatology (2024) 34:209–216

1 3

reported a mean period of NWB of 9 weeks [21]. On the 

other hand, a large analysis of aftercare protocols in foot 

and ankle fractures stated that weightbearing in calcaneal 

fractures still seemed to be allowed very cautiously. The 

analysis shows that almost half of the protocols recommend 

partial weightbearing only at postoperative week six, the 

other half of the protocols recommended 50% weightbearing 

after operative care at week six [29]. It represents the lack of 

knowledge on the comparison of different aftercare protocols 

after surgically treated DIACFs.

Based on our findings we conclude that there currently 

is no consensus whether to restrict patients in weightbear￾ing for 6, or 8 to 12 weeks. More and more studies show 

that permissive weightbearing reduces time to FWB, return 

to work, and thus lowers the socioeconomic impact, while 

negative effects on patients reported quality of life, pain or 

complication rates are rarely reported [30]. A recent review 

states multiple positive effects in early weightbearing while 

aftercare from operatively treated DIACFs [31]. Although 

many studies suggested the benefits of early weightbear￾ing, yet there currently is no prospective literature available 

that compares operatively treated DIACFs followed by 8 

to 12 weeks of restrictive weightbearing with permissive 

weightbearing, let alone subdivided for different fracture 

types or approaches. On the other hand, there is no recent 

evidence that demonstrates the advantages of restrictive 

weightbearing. Unfortunately, this study does not answer 

relations between complications and (early) weightbearing.

Strengths and limitations

The strength of this survey study is that it gives a good over￾view about the national expert opinion of trauma and ortho￾paedic surgeons involved in lower extremity fracture man￾agement. Moreover, as this study has some similarities with 

a survey study conducted by Schepers et al. (2008), it offers 

the opportunity to assess the general trend over time [21].

This study also has some limitations. First, this study is a 

national study. Although the Netherlands is a small country, 

it is well-known for its progressive healthcare policies, when 

it comes to outcomes, access to healthcare and drugs [32]. 

Therefore, the results of this study are limitedly generaliza￾ble to other European, North American, and Asian countries.

The results in the current study are survey-based. There￾fore, the results are subject to recall bias. To prevent the 

occurrence of recall error as much as possible, questions 

about situations in the distant past were excluded. Neverthe￾less, it has played a major role in the results of the current 

study. Besides, because this study is a Likert scaled survey, 

it is subject to information loss [33].

The overall response rate of the survey was lower com￾pared to the study performed by Schepers et al. However, 

in a Canadian study, a response rate of 29,6% was reported 

under general surgeons, which is slightly lower than the 

response rate of the current survey [34]. Moreover, our 

response rate is in line with another survey on calcaneal 

fractures [35]. Lastly, the study faced with incompleteness 

of data, as only 40% completed the entire questionnaire. 

This might indicate that the survey was too long. Paradoxi￾cally, reducing the number of questions might have led to a 

decrease in the amount of data gathered from Dutch foot￾and ankle surgeons.

Conclusion

This survey assessed the expert opinion on the treatment 

and aftercare of DIACFs in the Netherlands. We have dem￾onstrated that there is limited consensus on the aftercare of 

calcaneal fractures. The results of the current survey might 

demonstrate that surgeons in the Netherlands tend to be lib￾eral in using the international guidelines although scientific 

substantiation lacks. Moreover, it shows that the majority 

of surgeons are inclined to interpret the current non-weight 

bearing guidelines or their own local protocol freely. New 

guidelines, supported with well-founded literature, could 

help surgeons in a more appropriate daily practice in weight￾bearing for the aftercare of calcaneal fractures.

Objective: There has recently been a paradigm shift in the management of Achilles tendon rupture and

ankle fracture rehabilitation with emphasis on early mobilisation. There is, however, no consensus on

post-operative rehabilitation for hind/mid-foot fusion and reconstructive surgery.

The aim was to scope the post-operative rehabilitation practices of UK foot and ankle surgeons and allied

health professionals (AHPs).

Methods: A 10 question online survey was sent to UK surgeons and AHPs via specialist interest groups in

February 2019. Quantitative and qualitative data were analysed.

Results: 117 surgeons and 55 AHPs responded. There was good agreement between survey responses in

the 2 groups. Fifty percent reported that they followed a local post-operative rehabilitation protocol.

More than half of respondents (57%) reported that not all patients were referred for post-operative

rehabilitation. There was a wide variation in the time point at which patients were instructed to

weight bear (2 weeks to >12-weeks). Non-union was a concern of early mobilisation as highlighted by

62% of respondents. Qualitative themes identified were: treatment tailored to individual patients, lack of

knowledge about the patient journey, treatment tailored to surgeon preferences, lack of a pathway,

variation in practice.

Conclusions: There is a wide variation in the post-op rehabilitation of patients undergoing this surgery in

the UK, with a lack of published research in this area. Early rehabilitation could improve patient out￾comes, yet the risk of non-union is a major concern. Further research in the form of a multicentre trial is

warranted to answer this research question.

1. Introduction

Hind and midfoot fusion and reconstructive surgery is commonly

used to treat primary and secondary degenerative disease, inflam￾matory arthritis, post-traumatic and neurological conditions of foot

and ankle. Internal Fixation is used to stabilise joints so that the

mechanical environment is adequate for healing. The common de￾vices used are k-wires, compression screws and/or plates. The post￾operative management (including rehabilitation) may vary

depending on the aetiology and the type of fixation employed.1

Hind and mid-foot fusion/reconstructive procedures have a

lengthy period of non-weight bearing and external immobilisation

such as a plaster cast to aid sufficient bony healing There is, how￾ever, limited evidence or guidance for when weight-bearing should

begin and how long the external immobilisation.

A paradigm shift in the management of Achilles tendon rupture

and ankle fracture with a focus on early functional rehabilitation

has occurred over the previous decade. However, there is little

agreement on the period of immobilisation and post-operative

weight-bearing.2 The definition of ‘early’ rehabilitation/mobi￾lisation is poorly defined in the literature.

The population of patients suffering from ankle fractures and

tendo-achilles injury is comparable to the patient population of

those receiving hind or mid-foot fusion surgery.3 For these similar

patient populations, the evidence for early mobilisation and func￾tional rehabilitation is substantial. Recently, a systematic review

has reviewed and analysed the current evidence of early mobi￾lisation compared to prolonged immobilisation with tendo-achilles

and ankle fracture patient population.4 There is a reduced risk in

post-operative VTE (venous thromboembolism) for patients with

ankle fractures who mobilise early.5 Early mobilisation in the

tendo-achilles population improves patient functional outcomes

compared to usual care (prolonged immobilisation4,6

).

There are some concerns about complications with early

mobilisation and weight bearing in the fusion population.6 Com￾plications may be surgical site infection or surgical fixation failure.7

On the other hand, early rehabilitation and weight bearing in the

ankle fracture and tendo-achilles patient population also reduces

the risk of VTE (venous thromboembolism) and promotes healing

of both by weight bearing.8

The aim of this online survey was to scope the current practice

of UK surgeons and allied health professionals (AHPs) managing

patients with hind/mid-foot fusion and reconstructive procedures.

2. Methods

An online survey (10 questions) was designed (on survey￾monkey: California, USA) following qualitative synthesis of pub￾lished literature.9 See box 1. Some questions were multiple choice,

others had free text options and question 10 included both po￾tential positive and negative consequences of early rehabilitation.

This was sent out to surgeons and AHPs via their professional

clinical interest groups (BOFAS: British Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle

Society and AFAP: Association of Foot & Ankle Physiotherapist &

AHPs) in February 2019. Participants had 1 month to respond and

reminder emails were sent out periodically by BOFAS/AFAP.

Results were collated via the online surveymonkey system and

data were extracted in the form of tables and graphs. Raw data was

also available to transfer to Excel for analysis. Free text responses

were analysed using thematic analysis.10 Data was coded manually

to produce qualitative themes by 2 authors (LHW and RC).

3. Results

A total of 117 surgeons and 55 AHPs responded to the survey.

Approximately 40 hind foot and 30 mid foot procedures were

carried out by each centre in a calendar year.

89% of surgeons were consultant foot and ankle surgeons and

90% worked in the National Health Service (NHS). AHPs were pre￾dominately physiotherapists, with 36% being extended scope

practitioners (ESPs). 60% of AHPs were working in the NHS. In

general, there was good agreement between survey responses in

the 2 groups. Almost 50% reported that they followed a local post￾operative rehabilitation protocol.

There was a wide variation in the time point when patients were

instructed to begin weight bearing (from as early as 2 weeks to >12-

weeks). The majority of surgeons and AHPs agree that partial or full

weight bearing has been started at 6 weeks (Fig. 1).

More than half (57%) reported that not all patients were referred

for post-operative rehabilitation; 18% of surgeons did not know

what functional rehabilitation treatments their patients received

after referral to the Physiotherapist.

Table 1 shows the breadth of post-operative treatment in￾terventions and outcome measures reported in the survey. Non￾union was the major concern of early mobilisation as highlighted

by 62% of the surgeons surveyed. However More than half (60.9%) of

respondents also believed that starting some weight-bearing at 2-

weeks would reduce the risk of VTE. Table 2 outlines the full list of

theoretical positive and negative consequences of early mobilisation

(participants could select as many responses as they wished).

Qualitative themes from free text responses and exemplar

quotes are given in Table 3.

4. Discussion

There is wide variation in the management of patients following

hind/mid-foot fusion and reconstructive surgery in the UK. There is

paucity of high quality research and guidance in this area. This is in

keeping with a recent systematic review on this topic.11 Of partic￾ular interest, there was disparity between the time points at which

patients were instructed to begin weight bearing (from as early as 2

weeks to beyond 12-weeks) and only half of patients were

routinely referred to Physiotherapy following surgery. Further￾more, a multitude of rehabilitation treatment techniques and

outcome measures are being employed. Quantitative and qualita￾tive data from the survey complimented each other. However the

survey responses given by surgeons and AHPs were similar,

perhaps reflecting adherence to local protocols and/or close

working relationships between the MDT.

There are some other limitations to note. Firstly, the survey was

devised by the authors and has not been fully validated. To our

knowledge, there are no other scoping surveys of this kind in the

literature. Secondly the sample size is not representative of the

entire foot and ankle health care community and was only sent to

UK practitioners. We would welcome the validation of the survey

by other groups, in a larger sample size, both in and outside of the

UK setting. Our data collection methods were not sophisticated

enough to establish whether surgeons and AHPs from the same

institution were completing the survey, or not. This centre-specific

level information would have been useful. In addition the survey

was not able to pick out individual patient level data regarding

reason for fusion (e.g. degenerative or trauma) or type of fusion

undertaken (e.g k-wires or screws/plates); both of which may have

an impact on post-operative rehabilitation. Finally, as this was a

survey, it is not as robust as clinical data or research.

There is evidence in the literature9 that early rehabilitation

could improve patient outcomes in this patient population,

including reduced risk of VTE.5 However the risk of wound prob￾lems and non-union are a theoretical concern. However this has not

directly been investigated in early weight bearing compared to

non-weight bearing In recent years, there has been a paradigm shift

in the management of Achilles tendon rupture4 and ankle fracture

with an emphasis on early mobilisation.5 This is a treatment model

we propose to replicate in hind/mid-foot fusion and reconstruction

patient populations.

Further research in the form of a multicentre randomised

controlled trial (RCT) is warranted to answer this research question

and inform local and national guidance. This future work will

describe the cause of the fusion, as fusion following degenerative

changes/neuropathy may follow a different pattern of recovery as

compared to post-traumatic fusion surgery. We are currently

working on further qualitative research and propose to conduct a

two-centre feasibility randomised controlled trial of early func￾tional rehabilitation versus usual care, in the management of pa￾tients with hind/mid-foot fusion and reconstruction surgery.

There is wide variation in the management of patients following

hind/mid-foot fusion and reconstructive surgery.

Early mobilisation in this population may improve patient out￾comes. However risks of non-union and wound problems are of

concern.

Research is required to establish the feasibility and efficacy of

early mobilisation in this patient group.

Abstract

Background Retrograde intramedullary nailing with tibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis (TTCA) is a well-established 

procedure for management of hindfoot arthritis. This study aimed to evaluate the functional and radiological 

outcomes of TTCA with or without open debridement of the subtalar joint to determine whether formal subtalar joint 

is preparation necessary.

Methods A retrospective analysis of 48 patients who underwent TTCA with retrograde intramedullary nailing 

was conducted. Patients were divided into two groups: Group 1 (n=20) underwent open debridement of both 

the tibiotalar and subtalar joints, while Group 2 (n=28) underwent open debridement of the tibiotalar joint only, 

with closed intramedullary nail reaming of the subtalar joint. Outcomes were evaluated at mid-term and long term 

follow-up. Radiological findings, fusion rates, complications, and functional scores were compared between the 

groups.

Results Subtalar fusion rates were significantly higher in Group 1 compared to Group 2 (80% vs. 32%, p=0.001). Mid￾term complication rates were significantly lower in Group 2 (p=0.007), though Group 1 had a higher rate of nerve 

complications (p=0.004). Tibiotalar fusion rates did not differ significantly between the groups (p=0.936). Functional 

improvement, based on the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) and visual analog scale (VAS) 

scores, showed no significant differences between the groups at any follow-up time points (p>0.05). Subtalar 

nonunion was associated with significantly poorer long-term functional outcome scores.

Conclusions Open debridement of the subtalar joint during TTCA is essential for achieving optimal subtalar 

fusion. However, in cases where soft tissue conditions limit safe access to the subtalar joint, satisfactory functional 

outcomes and pain relief can still be achieved through tibiotalar fusion and subtalar joint immobilization, even 

without complete fusion. This approach may be particularly advantageous in post-traumatic or infectious cases with 

compromised soft tissue envelopes.

Introduction

The tarsal joints are interconnected through ligamentous 

and capsular structures, resulting in biomechanical inter￾dependence among them [1–3]. When the integrity of 

these joints is disrupted due to intra-articular fractures, 

adjacent fractures, avascular necrosis, septic arthritis, or 

neuropathic disorders [4–6]. Over time, such changes 

can significantly impair the alignment and function of the 

foot and ankle.

The tibiotalar and subtalar joints are particularly sus￾ceptible to degeneration after traumatic events, such as 

calcaneal fractures, pilon fractures, and trimalleolar frac￾ture-dislocations, as well as in conditions like rheumatic 

diseases and deformities [7]. Degenerative changes may 

also occur following previously failed fusion attempts. 

In such complex cases, tibiotalocalcaneal arthrod￾esis (TTCA) with retrograde intramedullary nailing has 

became as a preferred surgical technique to restore hind￾foot stability and alignment [7–9].

Both open and arthroscopic debridement of the tibio￾talar and subtalar joints during TTCA are well supported 

in the literature [10, 11]. However, the necessity of open 

subtalar joint debridement remains a subject of debate. 

While some cadaveric and clinical studies have reported 

successful subtalar fusion through intramedullary ream￾ing alone [12, 13], others emphasize that formal open 

debridement is essential to achieve optimal fusion rates 

and favorable clinical outcomes [14, 15]. This controversy 

underscores the need for a direct comparison these two 

surgical approaches.

Although various TTCA techniques have been 

explored in the literature, most studies have evaluated 

them independently, without direct comparison. To date, 

no study has systematically assessed the functional and 

radiological outcomes of TTCA performed with versus 

without formal subtalar joint debridement. Therefore, 

the aim of this study is to address this gap by determining 

whether open debridement of the subtalar joint is neces￾sary to achieve satisfactory subtalar fusion and functional 

outcomes in patients undergoing TTCA with retrograde 

intramedullary nailing.

Materials and methods

A retrospective evaluation was made of patients treated 

with tibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis (TTCA) with retro￾grade intramedullary nailing at our institution during 

the period form 2010 and 2015. Patients with concur￾rent degenerative changes in both the tibiotalar and 

subtalar joints were included. The following exclusion 

criteria were applied: neuromuscular or musculoskeletal 

disorders limiting objective functional assessment, neu￾ropathic conditions (e.g., diabetes with baseline sensory 

impairment), arthrodesis involving other tarsal joints, 

use of additional internal fixation materials together 

with intramedullary nailing, talectomy during surgery, 

revision TTCA following previously failed fusion with 

plates or screws performed at other institutions, follow￾up duration of less than 12 months, and morbid obe￾sity (BMI>45  kg/m²). After applying these criteria, 59 

patients met the inclusion criteria, and 48 patients who 

completed the final follow-up examination were included 

in the study. All procedures were performed by experi￾enced foot and ankle surgeons.

The patients were separated into two groups accord￾ing to the surgical approach. Group 1 included patients 

who underwent open debridement of both the tibiotalar 

and subtalar joints, followed by intramedullary ream￾ing. Group 2 consisted of patients who underwent open 

debridement of the tibiotalar joint only, without subtalar 

joint debridement, followed by intramedullary reaming. 

In all patients, autologous bone grafts (excised fibula or 

medial malleolus) were used to promote fusion. A sum￾mary of the demographic information of each group 

is provided in Table  1. Written informed consent was 

obtained from all patients prior to surgery.

Radiological and functional evaluation

Preoperative radiological assessment included the mea￾surement of hindfoot alignment angles using the hind￾foot alignment view (Fig. 1). In this technique, the X-ray 

beam was angled 20° downward, with the film cassette 

positioned perpendicular to the central beam of the radi￾ation source [16]. Correction of hindfoot alignment—

particularly the talocalcaneal angle-has been shown to be 

clinically relevant following arthrodesis procedures, as it 

correlates with improved functional scores and success￾ful deformity correction [17]. Postoperative radiological 

Highlights of the Study

• Open subtalar joint debridement improves fusion rates but does not significantly affect functional outcomes.

• Omitting subtalar debridement reduces surgery time and soft tissue complications while maintaining pain 

relief.

• Subtalar nonunion leads to worse long-term outcomes, though mid-term results remain comparable.

evaluations assessment of hindfoot angles and tibiotalo￾calcaneal fusion using standard radiographs. Computed 

tomography (CT) scans were performed between 6 and 

9 months postoperatively in cases where bridging cal￾lus was not visible in at least three anatomical planes, in 

order to evaluate for potential fibrous callus formation. 

Functional and pain outcomes were evaluated both 

preoperatively and at the final follow-up using the visual 

analog scale (VAS) for pain (range: 0–10), the Ameri￾can Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score 

[18], and the Roles–Maudsley scoring system [19]. Mean 

operative times and complication rates were compared 

between the groups.

Postoperative care

In the early postoperative period, patients were immo￾bilized with a short leg splint. After suture removal, 

the splint was replaced with a short leg circular cast. 

Between the 2nd and 8th postoperative weeks, partial 

weight-bearing not exceeding 15 kg was allowed. At the 

end of the 8th week, if cast deterioration was observed, it 

was replaced with a walking cast; otherwise, full weight￾bearing was initiated in the same cast. If no radiological 

signs of union were evident by the 12th postoperative 

week, cast treatment was extended for up to an addi￾tional month. The applied postoperative protocol reflects 

current literature recommendations for TTCA, consider￾ing the mechanical stress on the hindfoot, the need for 

dual-joint fusion, and the typically compromised patient 

profile [20–22]. Thromboprophylaxis with low-molec￾ular-weight heparin was administered for a minimum 

duration of eight weeks.

Statistical analysis

Data were presented as mean±standard deviation, mini￾mum, maximum, frequency, and percentage, as appro￾priate. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used to assess 

data normality. For independent quantitative data, the 

independent samples t-test or Mann–Whitney U-test 

was applied. For dependent quantitative data, paired 

samples t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank test was used. 

Independent qualitative data were analyzed using the 

Chi-squared test or Fisher’s exact test. Statistical signifi￾cance was set at p<0.05. All analyses were performed 

using Jamovi software (version 2.5.4.0).

This clinical trial was registered before patient enroll￾ment, but the registration number has been withheld for 

review.

Results

There were no significant differences between the two 

groups in terms of patient characteristics, except for sur￾gical duration, which was longer in Group 1 (Table  1). 

Similarly, no statistically significant differences were 

observed between the groups regarding postoperative 

hindfoot alignment angles or tibiotalar fusion rates on 

radiographic evaluation. However, the subtalar fusion 

rate was significantly higher in group 1 compared to 

Group 2 (Table 2) (Fig. 2).

Both groups demonstrated statistically significant post￾operative improvements in AOFAS, VAS, and Roles–

Maudsley scores (p<0.05, Table  2). Nevertheless, there 

were no statistically significant differences between 

the groups in terms of mean preoperative, postopera￾tive mid-term, or long-term AOFAS, VAS, or median 

Roles–Maudsley scores (p>0.05, Table 2). Group 1 dem￾onstrated a significantly higher rate of mid-term post￾operative complications compared to Group 2 (60.0% 

vs. 21.4%, p=0.007). Group 1 patients received a more 

invasive intervention due to the addition of open subta￾lar joint debridement. This required an additional inci￾sion and a more extensive surgical dissection, resulting 

in longer operative times as shown in Table 1. Although

the difference in long-term complication rates between 

the groups did not reach statistical significance (25.0% vs. 

42.9%, p=0.202), the higher numerical rate observed in 

group 2 may still be clinically relevant. Patients without 

subtalar union demonstrated significantly lower long￾term functional scores compared to those with successful 

fusion, whereas mid-term scores did not show significant 

differ between the two groups (Table 3).

Intraoperative fractures at the locking screw site in the 

tibial diaphysis were reported in two patients (10%) in 

Group 1; both were successfully managed with circular 

casts.

Mid-term outcomes

In Group 2, postoperative radiographs demonstrated tib￾ial diaphyseal cortical fractures in two patients, both of 

whom achieved union following treatment with short leg 

casts. Subtalar fusion failure was observed in one patient, 

necessitating revision surgery with cannulated screw 

fixation after intramedullary nail removal. Superficial 

wound infections occurred in two patients (7%) in Group 

2 and were effectively treated with oral antibiotics.

In Group 1, wound infections were identified in five 

patients (25%). Four of these cases responded well to oral 

antibiotic therapy. One patient required surgical debride￾ment due to persistent wound drainage and subsequently 

developed osteomyelitis. Amputation was recom￾mended; however, the patient declined further surgical 

intervention.

Additionally, deep vein thrombosis was reported in two 

patients from Group 1 and one patient from Group 2. No 

cases of pulmonary embolism were observed in either 

group.

Long-term outcomes

In Group 1, radiological assessments revealed signs of 

loosening around the nails and screws in three patients, 

accompanied by pain. Screw fractures were also detected 

in two patients. These complications led to second￾ary procedures: two patient with combined tibiotalar 

and subtalar nonunion underwent revision surgery with 

re-implantation of a new intramedullary nail. In two 

other patients, broken or loosened implants (nail and/

or screws) were removed, but due to patient preference, 

revision fusion was not performed despite the presence 

of subtalar nonunion. In one other patient, hardware was 

removed due to implant-related irritation.

In Group 2, radiological evaluation identified nail 

fractures in three patients and screw fractures in seven 

patients (Fig. 3). Two patients underwent revision nailing 

procedures due to combined tibiotalar and subtalar non￾union. One patient underwent cannulated screw fixation

Page 5 of 10 Ozkul et al. Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery and Research (2025) 20:408 

following nail removal due to symptomatic subtalar non￾union. Another patient, despite implant failure, declined 

re-fusion surgery after hardware removal. All these revi￾sion procedures were performed as management of 

complications and were monitored as part of the study’s 

outcome data. Superficial wound infections also occurred 

in two patients. Sensory hypoesthesia in the sural nerve 

dermatome was significantly more prevalent in Group 1 

(seven patients, 35%) compared to Group 2 (one patient, 

3.6%) (p=0.006).

Discussion

This study evaluated the outcomes of retrograde intra￾medullary nailing in patients undergoing tibiotalocalca￾neal arthrodesis (TTCA) for foot and ankle arthritis, with 

a comparison based on whether subtalar joint debride￾ment was performed. Our findings demonstrated that, 

although mid-term functional outcomes were similar 

between the groups, long-term outcomes were sig￾nificantly poorer in patients with subtalar nonunion. 

Nonetheless, improvements in hindfoot alignment were 

comparable across both groups.

Notably, subtalar joint nonunion was associated with 

poorer long-term functional outcomes, regardless of

whether subtalar joint preparation was performed. These 

findings are consistent with the growing body of litera￾ture emphasizing the relationship between fusion rates, 

clinical outcomes, and the importance of advanced imag￾ing in postoperative evaluation [23]. 

Tibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis (TTCA) is a widely 

accepted surgical intervention for management of 

degenerative changes in the foot and ankle joints [10, 

12]. A variety of fixation methods have been employed, 

including cannulated screws, arthrodesis plates, exter￾nal fixation, proximal tibial anatomic locking plates, and 

intramedullary nails [10, 13, 24]. Among these, Retro￾grade intramedullary nailing is commonly used in the 

treatment of advanced hindfoot pathologies. Although 

Charcot arthropathy was excluded from the present 

study, this method has been extensively reported in the 

literature for managing such cases [13, 25]. The primary 

objective of retrograde intramedullary nailing is not only 

to restore joint stability, but also to achieve successful 

tibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis and, ultimately, long-term 

pain relief and functional improvement [8, 9, 26]. Com￾pared to external fixation, which is associated with lower 

fusion rates and reduced mechanical stability, intramed￾ullary nailing has become the preferred option due to 

its superior biomechanical properties and reduced soft 

tissue distruption [10]. Although locking plates offer 

biomechanical advantages, particularly in osteoporotic 

bone, they are linked to higher rates of symptomatic non￾union [24, 27]. In contrast, intramedullary nailing allows 

for a minimally invasive approach, minimizing soft tissue 

trauma through smaller incisions [24, 26, 28]. In this 

study, retrograde intramedullary nailing was selected for 

patients with combined subtalar and tibiotalar arthritis 

due to its technical feasibility and high success rates in 

achieving fusion. Although neurologically based deformi￾ties were part of the exclusion criteria in our cohort, this 

technique has also been widely applied to such cases in 

the literature [29].

Long-term follow-up of patients with post-traumatic 

osteoarthritis has demonstrated the potential for varus 

or valgus malalignment in the hindfoot axis. Rammelt 

et al. [7] reported achieving anatomical hindfoot align￾ment in 92% of cases using hindfoot arthrodesis nails 

combined with debridement of both joints. Similarly, 

Gong et al. [10] emphasized the necessity of simultane￾ous debridement of the tibiotalar and subtalar joints to 

ensure hindfoot stability and alignment. In the pres￾ent study, hindfoot alignment improved significantly in 

both groups, even though formal open debridement of 

the subtalar joint was performed only in Group 1. This 

suggests that careful preoperative planning and strict 

adherence to retrograde nailing principles can result sat￾isfactory hindfoot alignment, even in the absence of sub￾talar joint debridement.

Hindfoot arthrodesis using intramedullary nails is 

associated with various complications, including infec￾tion, malunion, delayed union or nonunion, nail break￾age, plantar foot pain, stress fractures, and cortical 

hypertrophy. Among these, nonunion remains the most 

frequently reported complication (Fig. 4) [30, 31]. Several 

Fig. 3 A nail fracture that developed in a patient where the subtalar joint was not debrided

Page 7 of 10 Ozkul et al. Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery and Research (2025) 20:408 

studies have advocated for routine open debridement of 

the subtalar joint to improve fusion outcomes in TTCA 

[8, 32, 33]. Reported hindfoot fusion rates vary widely, 

ranging from 86 to 100% [9, 13, 25, 34]. Mader et al. [13] 

achieved complete fusion of both joints using retrograde 

intramedullary nailing without subtalar joint debride￾ment. In contrast, Lowe et al. [12], in a cadaveric study, 

demonstrated that retrograde reaming of the hindfoot 

resulted in the destruction of approximately 5.8% of the 

talus posterior facet and 4.0% of the calcaneus posterior 

facet. Richter et al. [34] reported that while some patients 

with incomplete fusion were able to mobilize pain-free, 

others continued to experience symptoms. In the present 

study, Group 2 demonstrated significantly lower subtalar 

joint fusion rates, despite the application of intramedllary 

reaming during the procedure. Although mid-term pain 

and functional scores were similar between the groups, 

patients with subtalar nonunion exhibited significantly 

worse long-term outcomes, as reflected in AOFAS, VAS, 

and Roles–Maudsley scores (Table  3). These findings

radiograph (c) shows solid fusion in the tibiotalar joint. Sagittal CT scan (d) and lateral radiograph (e) reveal subtalar joint nonunion

Page 8 of 10 Ozkul et al. Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery and Research (2025) 20:408 

suggest that, even in the absence of complete subtalar 

fusion, effective tibiotalar fusion, proper hindfoot align￾ment, and joint immobilization may be sufficient to 

achieve meaningful improvements in pain and function.

Patients undergoing TTCA often present with com￾promised soft tissue conditions, frequently as a result of 

prior surgical interventions. In cases where the subtalar 

joint is not prepared, the absence of an additional inci￾sion may allow for more limited soft tissue dissection, 

potentially reducing the risk of neurovascular injury [12]. 

Mendicino et al. [8] reported soft tissue necrosis in only 

5% of patients who underwent TTCA with intramedul￾lary nailing. Similarly, Fang et al. [32] noted that although 

simultaneous debridement of both joints prolonged the 

operating time (mean: 128  min), it resulted in success￾ful outcomes. In this study, omitting subtalar debride￾ment resulted in shorter operating times, reduced sural 

nerve injury, and fewer superficial infections; however, 

patients without subtalar fusion had significantly worse 

long-term functional outcomes. These findings under￾score the importance of individualized surgical planning 

and appropriate technique selection, suggesting that sat￾isfactory outcomes may still be achieved without subtalar 

joint debridement in carefully selected cases.

Our study demonstrated a notable difference in compli￾cation patterns between the two surgical groups. Group 

1, which underwent more extensive open debridement, 

exhibited higher mid-term complication rates—likely 

due to greater surgical exposure and increased risk of soft 

tissue-related issues. In contrast, Group 2 had fewer early 

complications but showed a higher rate of long-term 

issues, potentially related to subtalar nonunion. These 

findings suggest a clinical trade-off between short-term 

morbidity and long-term fusion success, depending on 

the surgical approach.

The relationship between bony fusion and clinical out￾comes has been extensively studied, with nonunion con￾sistently linked to poorer functional results [23, 35, 36]. 

Krause et al. [36] reported that nonunion was associated 

with lower AOFAS hindfoot and Foot Function Index 

(FFI) scores, as well as reduced quality of life. Addition￾ally, factors such as smoking, obesity, and unemployment 

were identified as risk factors for nonunion. Glazebrook 

et al. [23] reported significantly better functional out￾comes (SF-12, FFI, AOFAS) in patients with greater osse￾ous bridging at the fusion site. In our study, subtalar joint 

nonunion was similarly associated with inferior long￾term outcomes, although it did not significantly impact 

mid-term outcomes.

The retrograde intramedullary nailing technique has 

become a standard approach in TTCA, with multiple 

studies supporting its effectiveness. While formal open 

debridement of the subtalar joint is widely regarded 

as essential for achieving radiological fusion, our find￾ings suggest that omitting subtalar debridement may 

reduce operative time and soft tissue complications with￾out compromising mid-term pain relief or functional 

outcomes.

This study has several limitations. Its retrospective 

design introduces potential sources of bias, including 

incomplete data and selection bias. The relatively small 

sample size (48 patients) limits statistical power and 

generalizability. The heterogeneous patient population, 

which included both post-traumatic and rheumatologic 

cases, may have influced outcome comparisons. As a sin￾gle-center study, external validity is limited. Furthermore, 

procedures were performed by multiple senior surgeons, 

potentially introducing variability in technique. The lack 

of routine advanced imaging, such as postoperative CT 

scans, may have led to under or overestimation of fusion 

rates. Variability in postoperative care and rehabilitation 

protocols may also have influenced outcomes. Lastly, the 

study focused on radiological and functional results with￾out incorporating broader quality-of-life measures, which 

limits the comprehensiveness of outcome assessment.

Conclusion

Open debridement of the subtalar joint during TTCA 

remains important for achieving optimal subtalar fusion. 

However, in cases where soft tissue conditions preclude 

safe access to the subtalar joint, satisfactory pain relief 

and functional outcomes may still be obtained through 

tibiotalar fusion and subtalar joint immobilization, even 

in the absence of complete subtalar fusion. This approach 

may be particularly advantageous in post-traumatic or 

infectious cases with compromised soft tissue envelopes.

Abstract

Background The purpose of this study was to find the factors influencing successful bone union for isolated subtalar 

arthrodesis in posttraumatic subtalar arthritis following calcaneal fracture.

Material and methods We retrospectively analyzed the rate of successful bone union of 119 cases of isolated 

subtalar arthrodesis for posttraumatic subtalar arthritis performed at five university hospitals between January 2010 

and December 2019. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to find the factors associated with successful 

bone union. Successful bone union was defined as resolution of hindfoot pain with the presence of osseous trabecu￾lar bridging involving more than 50% of the posterior facet within 6 months postoperatively.

Results There were 77 (64.7%) cases of successful bone union, 11 (9.2%) cases of delayed union, 8 (6.7%) cases 

of questionable union, and 23 (19.3%) cases of nonunion. Use of fully threaded screws was 5.90 times [odds ratio 

(OR)=5.90, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.42–24.49, p=0.02] more likely to achieve successful bone union com￾pared to the use of partially threaded screws. Use of two parallel screws or the two divergent screws were 3.71 

times (OR=3.71, 95% CI=1.05–13.14, p=0.04) and 4.65 times (OR=4.65, 95% CI=1.23–17.53, p=0.02) more likely 

to achieve successful bone union compared to the use of a single screw. Use of cancellous autograft or structural 

autograft was 4.72 times (OR=4.72, 95% CI=1.17–19.06, p=0.03) and 7.12 times (OR=7.12, 95% CI=1.46–34.68, 

p=0.02) more likely to achieve successful bone union compared to no graft use.

Conclusion Use of fully threaded screws, autograft, and two screws compared to a single screw were the factors 

associated with successful bone union within six postoperative months after subtalar arthrodesis for the posttrau￾matic arthritis.

Introduction

Subtalar arthrodesis is performed to treat symptomatic 

subtalar arthritis not responding to conservative treat￾ment or is used to correct congenital and acquired 

deformities [1–5]. The outcomes of subtalar arthrodesis 

have generally been reported as favorable, but complica￾tions such as nonunion are still encountered [6, 7]. Many 

papers report that nonunion is not as uncommon as 

previously thought [2, 4, 7, 8]. In a large cohort study of 

184 consecutive isolated subtalar arthrodesis, a 16% rate 

of nonunion was reported2

. In that study, nonunion was 

significantly higher among patients with avascular bone 

at the site of the arthrodesis, and the presence of avascu￾lar bone was usually observed in association with a trau￾matic etiology. In a study of 115 patients who underwent 

subtalar arthrodesis for posttraumatic subtalar arthri￾tis, osseous consolidation was considered definite in 

only 55% of cases and was questionable in 21% of cases, 

while nonunion was observed in 24% of cases [5]. Post￾traumatic subtalar arthritis after calcaneal fracture can 

be different from other etiologies of subtalar arthrode￾sis because of the potential for insufficient blood supply 

or avascular sclerotic bone at the joint [2, 9, 10]. During 

calcaneal fracture reduction, the collapsed posterior facet 

fragment is elevated from the body of the calcaneus, and 

an empty space is created underneath the fragment where 

the bone graft is known to be not necessary. Although 

this empty space can be filled with bone at a later time, 

the blood supply to the posterior facet fragment can be 

compromised and can result in avascular necrosis of the 

bone [2]. Insufficient blood supply or avascular sclerotic 

bone at the joint can negatively affect joint fusion (Fig. 1). 

Furthermore, in cases where there is depression or step￾off at the posterior facet, it may be difficult to compress 

the calcaneus and talus for full bony contact at the joint 

to help increase stability. These factors should be con￾sidered for successful subtalar arthrodesis for posttrau￾matic subtalar arthritis. However, there are relatively few 

studies that have focused on subtalar arthrodesis only for 

treatment of posttraumatic subtalar arthritis following 

calcaneal fracture [4, 5, 9, 10].

Whether the reason for the subtalar arthrodesis is post￾traumatic or nontraumatic, nonunion is a debilitating 

result for patients, causing significant pain during walk￾ing [4, 5]. Risk factors for nonunion have previously been 

characterized as: cigarette smoking, diabetes, prior ankle 

fusion, and revision surgery [1–5]. Preventing nonunion 

is important and should be the aim of surgery. However, 

it can sometimes take more than a year to achieve bone 

consolidation and for the patient to be free of pain and 

return to activities of daily life and full employment5

. In 

such cases, success of treatment remains questionable 

even where bone union is ultimately achieved [4]. There￾fore, rapid and reliable bone healing that allows patients 

to return to normal activities as quickly as possible 

should also be the aim of surgery. Although several stud￾ies have analyzed risk factors for nonunion after subtalar 

arthrodesis, few studies focus on the factors for a rapid 

and reliable bone union after subtalar arthrodesis used 

specifically for posttraumatic arthritis. We regarded the 

subtalar arthrodesis to be successful when bone union 

could be confirmed within six postoperative months and 

combined with resolution of hindfoot pain. Question￾able union, delayed union, or nonunion were deemed

from the body of the calcaneus, and an empty space is created underneath the fragment (white arrow). Although this empty space can be filled

on the factors that can managed by surgeons to increase 

early and definitive union.

Materials and methods

Study design

This multicenter study reviewed 119 cases of isolated 

subtalar arthrodesis for posttraumatic subtalar arthri￾tis following calcaneal fracture performed at five uni￾versity hospitals between January 2010 and December 

2019 by five foot and ankle fellowship-trained orthope￾dic surgeons. The study was approved by the Institutional 

Review Boards of each participating hospital and all 

methods were performed in accordance with the relevant 

guidelines and regulations. Cases of patients undergoing 

isolated subtalar arthrodesis for posttraumatic subtalar 

arthritis following calcaneal fracture were included in the 

study. Cases of subtalar arthrodesis without a history of 

calcaneal fracture, or those treated in combination with 

ankle arthrodesis, ankle arthroplasty, or triple arthrode￾sis were excluded. Patients with uncontrolled diabetes, 

Charcot neuroarthropathy or infection around the sub￾talar joint were also excluded from this study. Medical 

records were reviewed for basic patient demographic 

data, including age, sex, cigarette smoking, diabetes, 

body mass index (BMI) in kg/m2

, and nonunion after 

prior subtalar arthrodesis, which are known to be the risk 

factors for nonunion after isolated subtalar arthrodesis. 

Patients’ operative records and postoperative radiographs 

were reviewed for type of screw used (partially, or fully 

threaded), screw configuration (single [11], parallel [12], 

divergent [13], or delta [14]), number of screws used, and 

use of bone graft (no graft, bone substitutes, allograft, 

cancellous autograft, and structural autograft). Patients’ 

informed consent was waived from the IRB as the study 

was on the patients’ medical records and radiographs.

Operative technique

Subtalar arthrodesis was performed by different surgeons 

utilizing a common technique; denudement of cartilage 

and subchondral bone until bone bleeding was seen. 

Screws used were either fully threaded 6.5 or 7.0  mm 

cannulated screws or partially threaded cannulated 

screws (Fig.  2). One or two screws were inserted into 

the calcaneal tuberosity and through the talus or with an 

additional screw inserted from the lateral calcaneus to 

form a delta configuration.

Autograft from the iliac crest, local autograft from 

the lateral calcaneal wall exostectomy, allograft, or bone 

substitute was inserted to fill any appreciable subtalar 

gap. There was not a uniform criterion for bone graft￾ing. The use of bone grafting or numbers and types of 

screw depended on surgeons’ preference rather than the 

cases. In cases of sclerotic avascular bone of the posterior 

facet, avascular bone was removed and any gap between 

talus and calcaneus of more than 1  cm was filled with 

autoiliac tricortical bone graft and fixed with one or two 

fully threaded screws (Fig. 3). Postoperatively, the hind￾foot was immobilized for 4–6  weeks and weightbearing 

was allowed after 8–12 weeks from the time of surgical 

fixation.

Outcome assessments

The primary outcome measure was osseous consolida￾tion at the subtalar joint. Bone union was evaluated by 

lateral foot radiograph with both-oblique and hindfoot 

axial images or computed tomography (CT) scan and 

based upon clinical features, such as persistence of pain 

or functional disabilities. Where simple radiographic 

and clinical evaluation remained inconclusive, CT scan 

evaluation was used to determine the extent of osseous 

consolidation [3]. Successful bone union was defined as 

resolution of hindfoot pain with the presence of osse￾ous trabecular bridging of more than 50% of the poste￾rior facet surface without evidence for screw loosening 

before the 6-month postoperative stage [15, 16]. Delayed 

union was defined as bridging callus or trabeculation 

observed beyond 6 months from the surgery. Nonunion 

was defined as the lack of bridging callus or trabeculation 

and continued pain for more than 1 year postoperatively, 

or any case requiring revision arthrodesis. Where some 

degree of bridging callus or trabeculation was observed 

but associated clinically with significant pain, the case 

was classified as questionable union. Screw loosening was 

defined as any discernible radiolucent halo around the 

screw or when the screw had moved from its immediate 

postoperative position. Radiologic union was indepen￾dently assessed by musculoskeletal radiologists. Out￾comes were deemed successful for cases that achieved 

resolution of hindfoot pain combined with evidence of 

adequate bone union within six postoperative months.

Statistical analysis

To estimate the association between variable factors 

such as age, sex, BMI, cigarette smoking, diabetes, revi￾sion subtalar arthrodesis, type of screw used (partially, 

or fully threaded), number of screws used (single, two￾and multiple-screw techniques), type of configuration 

(single, parallel, divergent, and delta configuration), 

use of bone graft (no graft, bone substitutes, allograft, 

cancellous autograft, and structural autograft) and the 

binary outcomes (successful bone union or failure of 

successful bone union), each predictor variable was first 

analyzed individually calculating odds ratios (OR) and 

their 95% confidence intervals (CI) in bivariate analysis. 

We then fitted the full multivariate logistic regression 

Page 4 of 10 Kim et al. Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery and Research (2023) 18:559 

model including all potential predictors. Predictors were 

excluded if the p value of the log likelihood ratio test was 

greater than 0.10. Predictor exclusion was continued until 

all remaining predictors had p<0.10. Only five of 119 

cases used a delta screw configuration, and these cases 

were excluded from the multivariate regression analysis. 

In the nonunion outcome model, given the large num￾ber of predictor variables with a relatively low number 

of events (23 nonunions), an interactive forward variable 

selection was done using explanatory values with p<0.05, 

to help mitigate potential overfitting. Statistical analyses 

were performed using the SPSS version 21.0 (IBM Cor￾poration, Armonk, NY, USA). Differences with p values 

of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results

The results of our review are summarized in Table 1. Suc￾cessful bone union with osseous consolidation and reso￾lution of hindfoot pain within six postoperative months 

was achieved in 77 (64.7%) cases, while 11 (9.2%) cases 

resulted in delayed union, eight (6.7%) cases resulted in a 

questionable union, and 23 (19.3%) cases were deemed to 

reflect that of a bony nonunion.

There were 5 cases with the screw penetrating to the 

ankle joint, 18 cases with screw loosening that led to non￾union and 9 cases with screw loosening that eventually 

achieved bone union. Use of fully threaded screws, two 

parallel or two divergent screws, and use of autograft, 

were the variables associated with successful bone union 

within six postoperative months after subtalar arthrode￾sis for posttraumatic subtalar arthritis based on multivar￾iate logistic regression analysis. The Hosmer–Lemeshow 

goodness of fit test (X2=4.94, p=0.76) showed that the 

model had a good calibration degree. The presence of 

diabetes decreased the probability of successful bone 

union (OR=0.13, 95% CI=0.03–0.61, p=0.01). Use of 

fully threaded screws was 5.90 times (OR=5.90, 95% 

CI=1.42–24.49, p=0.02) more likely to achieve suc￾cessful bone union compared to using partially threaded 

screws in the multivariate regression analysis. Use of two 

parallel screws or the two divergent screws were 3.71 

times (OR=3.71, 95% CI=1.05–13.14, p=0.04) and 

Fig. 2 a, b Nonunion was observed on the lateral radiograph and CT scan of a 67-year-old male patient after using a single partially threaded 

screws for the subtalar arthrodesis. c, d Bone union was observed in a 56-year-old male patient after using two fully threaded screws in divergent 

configuration

4.65 times (OR=4.65, 95% CI=1.23–17.53, p=0.02) 

more likely to achieve successful bone union compared 

to the use of a single screw. Use of cancellous autograft 

or structural autograft was 4.72 times (OR=4.72, 95% 

CI=1.17–19.06, p=0.03) and 7.12 times (OR=7.12, 95% 

CI=1.46–34.68, p=0.02) more likely to achieve success￾ful bone union compared to no graft use.

The union rates of the cases that used fully threaded 

screws (Additional file  1), two parallel or divergent 

screws (Additional file  2), and autografts (Additional 

file 3) were significantly higher compared to that of the 

cases that used partially threaded screws, a single screw, 

and no graft. However, the number and the configura￾tion of screws and the use of bone graft were not evenly 

distributed between the study groups that they were not 

comparable.

We also studied the factors that were associated with 

nonunion (Additional file  4). The presence of diabe￾tes increased the probability of nonunion by 5.38 times 

(OR=5.38, 95% CI=1.51–19.18, p=0.01). Use of 

two screws was 82% (OR=0.18, 95% CI=0.06–0.55, 

p=0.002) less likely to develop nonunion compared 

to the use of a single screw in the multivariate regres￾sion analysis. Furthermore, use of autograft was 79% 

(OR=0.21, 95% CI=0.06–0.76, p=0.02) less likely to 

develop nonunion compared to use of no graft.

Discussion

The most important finding of the present study was 

demonstrating that the use of fully threaded over par￾tially threaded screws, use of two screws compared to 

use of a single screw, and use of autograft compared to no 

graft use were the factors associated with successful bone 

union within six postoperative months of arthrodesis.

Two factors are known to be the key to successful bone 

union: the mechanical stability of fixation; and the bio￾logic factors that play a pivotal role in osseous consoli￾dation [7, 17]. Most of the cases of subtalar arthrodesis

tricortical bone (white arrow) which was fixed with two fully threaded screws. d Osseous consolidation was confirmed on the plain radiograph

reported in the literature were performed utilizing the 

Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Osteosynthesefragen (AO) 

Working Group for Osteosynthesis principles for frac￾ture treatment using large diameter partially threaded 

screws as a lag screw to compress the calcaneus toward 

the talus for a stable fixation (Fig.  3) [2, 7, 18–20]. Use 

of more than one screw and creating a delta configura￾tion are treatment features proven to add stability to sub￾talar fixation in biomechanical studies [13, 14, 18, 21]. 

However, subtalar arthrodesis for posttraumatic subtalar 

arthritis with depression or step-off at the posterior facet 

can be different from fracture fixation using the lag screw 

technique, because sometimes it is difficult to achieve 

full contact between bones at the joint. Where there is a 

large amount of avascular bone, removal of such sclerotic 

avascular subchondral bone until there is bone bleeding 

can result in a wide gap formed between talus and cal￾caneus. Partially threaded lag screws are effective on the 

premise that the fracture fragment achieves full contact 

with the fractured bone (Fig.  4a) [17, 22–24]. However, 

in a situation where contact between the fractured bones 

cannot be achieved, the smooth unthreaded-shaft of the 

screw cannot gain enough purchase to hold the bone, 

allowing bone movement and leading to screw loosen￾ing and to failure of fixation (Fig.  4b) [25]. Where such 

full contact of bones cannot be achieved or when com￾pression cannot be maintained by a partially threaded lag 

screw, use of fully threaded screws can be a better option 

to hold both bones and achieve stable fixation (Fig.  4c) 

[24, 26]. Further, the subtalar joint sustains shear forces 

during weightbearing because the subtalar joint axis is 

inclined about 41 degrees from the horizontal foot axis 

[14, 27–31]. In a mechanical study of 36 sawbone blocks 

to test shear strength and resistance, use of fully threaded 

screws had significantly greater stiffness against shear 

forces compared to the use of partially threaded lag 

screws (106.1 vs 80.1 N/mm, p=0.03) [26]. In a biome￾chanical study on 10 pairs of cadaveric subtalar joints, 

two fully threaded tapered screws for subtalar joint fixa￾tion provided markedly better resistance to rotation

than identically placed conventional partially threaded 

lag screws, with an approximately fourfold increase in 

torsional stiffness and a corresponding decrease in the 

amount of joint rotation in response to provoking tor￾sional loads [23]. What drew our attention in other stud￾ies was the high union rate after subtalar distraction 

bone block arthrodesis. A systemic review of subtalar 

distraction arthrodesis reported a 94% of union rate in 

492 total cases from 24 studies [31]. Chahal et  al. [15] 

reported a significantly higher union rate of 95% after a 

subtalar bone block distraction arthrodesis compared to 

a 65% rate of bone union after a standard in situ subta￾lar arthrodesis without bone grafting (p<0.05). Many 

factors can be attributed to the high rate of bone union 

achieved from subtalar distraction arthrodesis compared 

to the standard in situ subtalar arthrodesis. One reason 

may be that distracting the joint forcibly and inserting 

a bone block achieves full bone contact and use of fully 

threaded screws to maintain bone height increases the 

stability of fixation. On the other hand, for a standard 

in  situ subtalar arthrodesis, even with compression of 

the subtalar joint through a partially threaded lag screw, 

some cases may not achieve full contact between calca￾neus and talus, particularly in cases with a depressed cal￾caneal posterior facet (Fig.  5). In our clinical study, use 

of fully threaded screws was 5.90 times (OR=5.90, 95% 

CI=1.42–24.49, p=0.02) more likely to achieve success￾ful bone union compared to the use of partially threaded 

screws. However, future prospective randomized con￾trolled study comparing the use of fully threaded screws 

versus partially threaded screws placed in the same con￾figuration is required to confirm the finding.

Biomechanical and cadaveric studies show higher 

compressive force, torsional stiffness, and joint rota￾tion resistance achieved through double-screw fixation 

compared to a single screw [13, 14]. However, in clinical 

studies, no significant difference in rates of bone union 

between single and double screw fusion techniques has 

yet to be demonstrated [11, 32]. In a study of 113 patients 

who underwent isolated subtalar arthrodesis, the fusion 

rate was not significantly different between use of a sin￾gle screw and double screw techniques (85.4% vs 75%, 

p=0.37) [18]. However, only 25 (22.1%) cases were for 

the treatment of posttraumatic subtalar arthritis. In our 

study, restricted to the analysis of subtalar arthrodesis 

used in the treatment of posttraumatic arthritis, use of 

two parallel screws or the two divergent screws were 3.71 

times (OR=3.71, 95% CI=1.05–13.14, p=0.04) and 4.65 

times (OR=4.65, 95% CI=1.23–17.53, p=0.02) more 

likely to achieve successful bone union compared to the 

use of a single screw.

Biologic factors also play an important role in osseous 

consolidation [33]. The bony calcaneus is rich in vascu￾lar supply such that avascular necrosis of the calcaneus 

is extremely rare [34]. However, following open reduc￾tion of a calcaneal fracture, there is the possibility for a 

decrease in blood supply to the posterior facet fragment; 

because the collapsed posterior facet fragment is elevated 

and occasionally detached from the body of the calcaneus 

Fig. 4 a A partially threaded lag screw is effective on the premise 

that the fracture fragment achieves full contact with the fractured 

bone. The fracture fragment is fully opposed against the fractured 

bone and is fixed between the screw head and the frictional force 

generated at the fracture surface. b In a situation where contact 

between the fractured bones cannot be achieved, the smooth 

unthreaded shaft of the screw cannot gain purchase to adequately 

hold the bone together, allowing bone movement (arrow) leading 

to screw loosening (dotted line) and failure of fixation. c Use of fully 

threaded screws can afford the bony purchase for better opposition 

and fixation of fractured surfaces. In such cases, bone grafting can 

enhance bone union

during fracture reduction and reduced into the medial 

fragment, creating empty space inferior to the posterior 

facet fragment where bone graft is known to be not nec￾essary [35, 36]. Although this empty space can later be 

filled with bone, blood supply to the posterior facet frag￾ment can be decreased and result in avascular necrosis of 

bone [2]. Easley et al. [2] found more than 2 mm of avas￾cular subchondral bone at the subtalar joint in 45 (41%) 

out of 109 posttraumatic subtalar arthritis cases follow￾ing calcaneal fracture. They identified a 38% rate of non￾union in feet with evidence of devascularized bone. In 

their study, every one of 30 patients with nonunion had 

more than 2  mm of avascular subchondral bone. Insuf￾ficient blood supply or avascular sclerotic bone at the 

joint can negatively affect joint fusion. Furthermore, talus 

is known to be low in blood vessel network and to lack 

collateral blood supply. Bone grafting can help to achieve 

early successful bone union after subtalar arthrodesis in 

cases of posttraumatic arthritis. Autografting may rep￾resent the better choice where there is avascular bone at 

the subtalar joint. In our study of posttraumatic subtalar 

arthritis after calcaneal fracture, 53.1% of patients with 

autograft achieved successful bone union within six post￾operative months compared to 37.9% of those without 

bone grafting. Use of cancellous autograft or structural 

autograft was 4.72 times (OR=4.72, 95% CI=1.17–19.06, 

p=0.03) and 7.12 times (OR=7.12, 95% CI=1.46–34.68, 

p=0.02) more likely to achieve successful bone union 

compared to no graft use. In seven cases, necrotic bone 

at the joint was removed and resulted in a gap of more 

than 1 cm. In those cases, autoiliac tricortical bone was 

inserted and, in each case, achieved successful bone 

Fig. 5 a Subtalar arthrodesis is performed using a large diameter partially threaded screw as a lag screw intended to compress the calcaneus 

with the talus for a stable fixation. b In a situation where full contact of talus and calcaneus cannot be achieved, particularly in cases 

with a depressed calcaneal posterior facet or when a wide gap is created after resection of avascular bone, the smooth unthreaded shaft 

of the screw may not gain bony purchase enough to hold the calcaneus. c In this situation, use of fully threaded screws can help gain purchase 

to both bones and be a better option for achieving a stable fixation. A bone grafting may enhance bone union. d A structural autograft can 

enhance bone union in cases of a wide gap between talus and calcaneus after resection of avascular bone

union (Fig. 3). Although it is likely that use of autograft 

remains superior to the use of allograft or bone substi￾tute for achieving bone union at the graft site, morbidity 

at the donor site or the time required to harvest the graft 

may suggest reasons for opting against use of autograft 

[7]. Similarly, although using an allograft or bone substi￾tute or even opting to forego grafting altogether, can give 

similar rates of bone union as that of autografting, when 

the application of an autograft can help achieve early and 

definite bone union, may present another indication for 

its use [37]. However, a future prospective randomized 

trial is required to warrant this finding.

The strength of this study is the large sample size of 

subtalar arthrodesis specifically for the treatment of 

posttraumatic subtalar arthritis following calcaneal frac￾ture. Previous studies have focused on the risk factors 

for nonunion after subtalar arthrodesis [9]. However, 

to the best of our knowledge, no study yet has focused 

on the factors that can increase rates of fusion for cases 

of posttraumatic subtalar arthritis only. Moreover, our 

study involved multiple centers and multiple surgeons. 

The participation of multiple surgeons likely improves 

the generalizability of our findings, increasing the exter￾nal validity and applicability of our results to clinical 

practice. However, although all participating surgeons at 

different centers had followed generalized principles for 

subtalar arthrodesis technique, there remains the pos￾sibility for a difference in outcomes due to difference in 

both device use and surgical technique. Surgeons them￾selves changed their techniques during the time to seek 

for better outcomes. There was not a uniform criterion 

for bone grafting. The use of bone grafting or numbers 

and types of screw depended on surgeons’ preference 

rather than the cases. This could have led to selection 

bias. With a wide variety of surgical methods, decision￾making process, screw choice, and postoperative care, 

it may not be appropriate to test a hypothesis. The best 

scientific method may be a prospective randomized con￾trolled trial. However, we believe a case series, such as 

this study, also has its’ value to generate a hypothesis that 

subsequently can be tested in studies of greater methodo￾logical rigor. We considered a range of possible factors 

that could affect the surgical outcome, such as the num￾ber and the types of screws used, different screw configu￾rations, and the use of bone grafting in the multivariate 

logistic regression analysis. Our study did not analyze for 

different screw make nor diameters of screws used, which 

can be potential confounders in the analysis. In a biome￾chanical study on subtalar arthrodesis, however, increas￾ing the screw diameter from 6.5 to 8.0 mm resulted in no 

additional stability of the arthrodesis [21].

CT scanning was not routinely applied to evaluate 

extent of bone union in this study. In an ideal comparison, 

bone union would be confirmed by CT scan in all cases, 

although this would expose many patients to unnecessary 

radiation. CT scans were reserved for patients with per￾sistent pain or those without evidence of osseous consoli￾dation on plain radiograph, as proposed by Davies et al. 

[38] Another limitation of the study is that we excluded 

patients with infection which is considered an important 

risk factor for nonunion. In the study, we focused more 

on the factors influencing successful bone union, espe￾cially those that can be controlled by surgeons. Moreover, 

it was not possible in this retrospective study to account 

for all potential confounders due to the limitations in 

the application of retrospective data. A future prospec￾tive randomized study with assessment of functional out￾comes may confirm our findings to further guide clinical 

practice.

Conclusion

Use of fully threaded screws, autograft, and two screws 

compared to a single screw was the factors associated 

with successful bone union within six postoperative 

months after subtalar arthrodesis for the posttraumatic 

arthritis. A future prospective randomized study with 

assessment of functional outcomes may confirm our 

findings to further guide clinical practice.

后足外科术后康复训练与评估的研究现状

引言

后足损伤是骨科领域的常见问题，尤其是跟骨骨折，其治疗和康复过程复杂，涉及多种手术方法和康复策略

。近年来，随着微创技术的发展和康复理念的更新，后足外科手术后的康复训练与评估成为研究热点。例如，郝

明等人（2023）通过跗骨窦切口牵引撬拨复位微型钢板联合全螺纹松质骨螺钉内固定治疗Sanders Ⅱ、Ⅲ型跟骨骨

折，取得了良好的临床疗效。胡姣姣（2017）探讨了跟骨骨折微创内固定术的治疗过程，发现微创手术能够有效

恢复跟骨的解剖结构和功能。此外，景韵瑶等人（2023）研究了运动康复对跟腱断裂术后踝关节功能恢复的效果

，表明运动康复可以显著提升患者的临床效果和生活质量。李兴华等人（207）则通过后足重建术恢复了严重后足

损伤患者的外形和功能。这些研究表明，术后系统的康复训练对于提高治疗效果、减少并发症和促进功能恢复具

有重要意义。因此，本综述旨在全面总结后足外科术后康复训练与评估的最新研究进展，为临床实践提供科学依

据。

1. 后足外科术后康复训练的必要性与重要性

后足外科术后康复训练是恢复患者足部功能的关键环节。足部是人体重要的承重部位，其功能的恢复直接关

系到患者的日常生活质量和独立行动能力。术后康复训练不仅可以促进骨折愈合，还可以减少并发症的发生，提

高患者的生活质量。因此，术后康复训练在后足外科手术后的整体治疗方案中占有极其重要的地位。

景韵瑶等（2023)研究了跟腱断裂术后患者使用常规疗法结合运动康复疗法的治疗效果，发现运动康复疗法能

够显著提高患者的踝关节功能恢复，减少并发症的产生，提高患者的生活质量。王海龙等（2011)探讨了系统康复

治疗对跟骨骨折术后功能恢复的作用，结果显示系统康复治疗在术后8周和14周的踝关节活动范围、足部等方面显

著优于未进行系统康复治疗的对照组。吴晓妹（2017)研究了术后早期康复护理对跟骨骨折患者的效果，发现早期

康复护理显著提高了患者接受康复训练的依从性和治疗的有效率。这些研究表明，术后康复训练不仅能够促进功

能恢复，还能提高患者的整体治疗效果。

综上所述，后足外科术后康复训练对于患者的康复至关重要。通过系统的康复训练，可以显著提高患者的足

部功能，减少并发症，提高生活质量。因此，术后康复训练应作为后足外科手术治疗的重要组成部分。

2. 康复训练的具体方法与实施

后足外科术后康复训练的具体方法和实施步骤是确保康复效果的关键。不同的手术类型和患者个体差异决定

了康复训练的内容和强度需要个性化设计。通常，康复训练包括消除肿胀、增加关节活动度、增强肌肉力量、本

体训练和步态训练等多个阶段。每个阶段的训练内容和目标都不同，需要根据患者的具体情况进行调整。

王海龙等（2011)将跟骨骨折术后的康复治疗分为四个阶段：第一阶段（术后2天至2周）主要进行消肿和止痛

；第二阶段（术后2至6周）增加关节活动度；第三阶段（术后6至12周）增强肌肉力量；第四阶段（术后12至

16周）进行本体感觉和步态训练。杨博等（2022)也采用了类似的分期康复方案，发现系统康复治疗显著提高了患

者的治疗效果，改善了踝足活动度和AOFAS评分。这些研究均表明，分阶段的康复训练能够更有效地促进患者的

康复。

综上所述，后足外科术后康复训练的具体方法和实施步骤需要根据患者的具体情况进行个性化设计分阶段的

康复训练方案已被证明能够显著提高患者的康复效果，因此在临床实践中应广泛推广。

3. 康复训练的效果评估与监测

康复训练的效果评估与监测是确保康复过程顺利进行的重要手段。通过定期评估患者的康复进展，可以及时

调整治疗方案，确保最佳的康复效果。常用的评估工具包括AOFAS踝-后足评分系统、Arner-Lindholm评分法、

Cumberland踝关节不稳定性问卷等。这些评估工具能够全面反映患者的足部功能恢复情况，为医生提供科学的决

策依据。

杨博等（2022)使用AOFAS踝-后足评分系统对跟骨骨折术后患者进行了评估，发现系统康复治疗组的疼痛、

功能、对线评分均显著高于对照组。景韵瑶等（2023)也采用了Arner-Lindholm法和Cumberland踝关节不稳定性

问卷对跟腱断裂术后患者进行了评估，结果显示运动康复疗法组的评分显著优于对照组。这些研究表明，科学的

评估工具能够准确反映患者的康复进展，为调整治疗方案提供依据。

综上所述，康复训练的效果评估与监测是确保康复效果的重要手段。通过使用科学的评估工具，可以全面了

解患者的康复进展，及时调整治疗方案，确保最佳的康复效果。

4. 术后早期康复护理的重要性

术后早期康复护理是促进患者快速康复的关键环节。早期康复护理不仅能够减轻患者的疼痛，还可以预防并

发症的发生，提高患者的生活质量。早期康复护理通常包括心理护理、术前术后护理、康复指导等内容。通过早

期干预，可以显著提高患者的康复效果。

吴晓妹（2017)研究了术后早期康复护理对跟骨折患者的效果，发现早期康复护理显著提高了患者接受康复训

练的依从性和治疗的有效率。佟冬梅（2015)探讨了跟骨骨折手术治疗患者的临床护理方法与康复指导对策，发现

通过心理护理、术前术后护理与康复指导，患者的患足评分优良率高达94.8%，且术后1、2、3天均未出现明显疼

痛症状。这些研究表明，术后早期康复护理能够显著提高患者的康复效果。

综上所述，术后早期康复护理对于促进患者的快速康复至关重要。通过早期干预，可以显著提高患者的康复

效果，减少并发症的发生，提高患者的生活质量。因此，术后早期康复护理应作为后足外科手术治疗的重要组成

部分。

5. 快速康复理念在后足外科术后康复中的应用

快速康复理念是一种以循证医学为基础、以多学科协作为核心的康复模式。在后足外科术后康复中，快速康

复理念通过围手术期优化管理、早期功能锻炼、疼痛控制、营养支持等综合措施，能够有效促进患者的快速康复

，缩短住院时间，降低并发症发生率，提高患者满意度。

佟海超等（2025)研究了快速康复理念在下肢骨折患者康复治疗中的应用进展，发现通过围手术期优化管理、

早期功能锻炼、疼痛控制、营养支持等综合措施，能够显著促进患者的快速康复，缩短住院时间，降低并发症发

生率，提高患者满意度。闫永亮（2025)探讨了跟骨骨折的发病机制、手术选择与康复要点，强调了早期康复介入

的重要性，并介绍了合理的功能锻炼方法与康复辅助手段。这些研究表明，快速康复理念在后足外科术后康复中

具有重要的应用价值。

综上所述，快速康复理念在后足术后康复中具有重要的应用价值。通过综合管理措施，可以显著促进患者的

快速康复，提高患者的生活质量。因此，快速康复理念应作为后足外科术后康复的重要指导思想。

结论

后足外科术后康复训练与评估的研究现状表明，微创手术技术在跟骨骨折治疗中展现出显著优势，能够有效

减少术后并发症的发生，提高骨折愈合质量和患者的功能恢复。例如，采用跗骨窦切口牵引撬拨复位微型钢板联

合全螺纹松质骨螺钉内固定的微创手术方法，不仅实现了良好的骨折复位和固定，还避免了传统开放手术带来的

INTRODUCTION

The calcaneus is the most commonly fractured bone in the foot, with 65-70% of fractures being in￾tra-articular1

. The management of calcaneal fractures has been controversial for over a century2-8. De￾spite advancements in diagnostic and therapeutic techniques, complications persist following open 

reduction and internal fixation9,10. 

Minimally invasive techniques aim to restore joint function and promote healing with fewer com￾plications, offering an alternative treatment for displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures11. 

Displaced calcaneal fractures typically occur in young and middle-aged male industrial workers12. 

Approximately 20% of patients with lower extremity fractures are unable to return to work one year 

after the injury, and few patients resume their previous level of activity or sport following an intra-ar￾ticular calcaneal fracture12,13.

ABSTRACT – Objective: The management of calcaneal fractures remains a topic of ongoing debate in the 

literature. This study aims to compare the functional outcomes of patients treated with an external fixator (EF) 

after percutaneous reduction with those treated using minimally invasive open reduction and internal fixation 

with a locking plate (LP).

Patients and Methods: This retrospective study included 27 patients with 28 calcaneal fractures (Sanders 

type II and III), 12 with EF and 16 with LP, treated at Carlo Poma Hospital (Mantua, Italy) from 2014 to 2018. The 

average patient age at the time of surgery was 46.3 years. The mean follow-up period was 123.3 months for the 

EF group and 101.2 months for the LP group. American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scores were 

recorded, patients’ satisfaction based on AOFAS scores was considered, and all underwent CT scans to assess 

calcaneal geometry, subtalar joint restoration, and post-traumatic arthritis.

Results: The mean AOFAS score for patients treated with EF was 74.1 (range 37-100). Of these, 66.7% rated 

their results as excellent or good. The mean AOFAS score for patients treated with LP was 76 (range 55-88), with 

75% reporting excellent or good outcomes. The mean increase in Böhler’s angle was 18.9° following EF and 15.9° 

following LP. One case of algodystrophy and one case of secondary subtalar arthrodesis were observed. 

Conclusions: The functional and radiographic outcomes of the two surgical methods are comparable. Both LP 

and EF offer the benefits of minimally invasive procedures, enabling adequate fracture reduction and restoration 

of calcaneal volume. Minimally invasive reduction and osteosynthesis yield results similar to open surgery while 

reducing postoperative complications.

2 MINIMALLY INVASIVE TREATMENT OF CALCANEUS FRACTURE

Patients who sustain displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures exhibit poorer general health 

status (as assessed by the SF-36 questionnaire) compared to those who have suffered myocardial 

infarctions or undergone organ transplants14. 

In literature, several surgical techniques are described, from the extensile lateral approach to the 

minimally invasive. Our clinical-surgical experience has always been based on minimally invasive sur￾gery, according to the advantages that this entails. Over the years, at our hospital, we have employed 

two different techniques (external and percutaneous fixation) based on the experience of the oper￾ating surgeons (MB and AP).

This study aims to evaluate the long-term outcomes of two different surgical treatments for Sand￾ers type II and III calcaneal fractures using percutaneous and minimally invasive techniques: locking 

plates (LP) with a sinus tarsi approach and external fixation (EF).

PATIENTS AND METHODS

This retrospective study included 27 patients with 28 Sanders type II or III calcaneal fractures, treated 

at Carlo Poma Hospital (Mantua, Italy) from January 2014 to December 2018.

The study protocol was approved by the local Ethics Committee (Val Padana 39/2018) on June 19, 

2019. 

The data were collected from a minimum 6-year follow-up (range 6-10 years).

The patients’ ages ranged from 21 to 72 years (mean 46.3) at the time of surgery, with 16 males 

and 11 females. Fifteen fractures occurred in the right heel, and 13 in the left (Table 1). The fractures 

resulted from falls in 15 cases and motor vehicle accidents in 12.

The first 12 fractures were treated with percutaneous reduction and EF (Orthofix®

 mini-fixator, 

Figure 1), while the subsequent 16 fractures were treated with percutaneous plate fixation (Zim￾mer-Biomet®

, Figure 2) using a minimally invasive sinus tarsi approach. Preoperative CT scans were 

performed for surgical planning.

Fractures were classified as type II (6 cases) and type III (22 cases) according to the Sanders clas￾sification15. Inclusion criteria were calcaneus height loss >1.5 cm, subtalar joint displacement >1 mm, 

and varus malalignment >5°. Exclusion criteria included Sanders type I and IV fractures, compound 

fractures, follow-up <6 years, associated long-bone fractures, and patients under 16 or over 75 years 

of age. 

The mean follow-up period was 123.3 months for the EF group and 101.2 months for the LP group.

Böhler’s and Gissane’s angles16,17 were measured on the pre- and post-operative lateral radio￾graphs (Figure 3a-d).

Surgical Techniques

Patients were positioned in the lateral decubitus position to expose the lateral surface of the 

heel. The procedure was performed under general or locoregional anesthesia with an Esmarch 

tourniquet.

3 MINIMALLY INVASIVE TREATMENT OF CALCANEUS FRACTURE

In the sinus tarsi approach, a 4 cm incision is started just below the tip of the lateral malleolus, 

in line with the anterior malleolar cortex, heading towards the base of the fourth metatarsal. The 

next step is to bluntly dissect soft tissues above the peroneal tendons, avoiding injury to either the 

tendons or the sural nerve.

The lateral wall of the calcaneus is then bluntly dissected using a large Cobb elevator, allowing for 

plate insertion and the restoration of the subtalar articular surface and calcaneal volume. Provisional 

fixation was achieved with K-wires, and the plate was inserted using a targeting guide. Percutaneous 

screws were then placed under guidance (Figure 4a-b).

For external fixation, a 1 cm lateral incision was made over the sinus tarsi, and a small lever 

was used for percutaneous reduction. Two pins were placed in the main fracture fragments, 

and the mini fixator body was used to position additional pins based on the fracture pattern. 

After applying the fixator, further reduction and elevation of the fracture fragment were per￾formed.

All surgeries were performed by experienced surgeons. The operations were completed within 11 

days post-trauma (mean 92.3 minutes for LP, range 60-130 minutes; 76.7 minutes for EF, range 45-115 

minutes). The average hospital stay was 8.5 days (range 4-15) for the EF group and 7.2 days (range 

3-14) for the LP group (Table 1).

Postoperatively, patients treated with LP were immobilized in a short-leg cast for 4 weeks, fol￾lowed by partial weight-bearing for another 3 weeks. EF-treated patients began passive and active 

ankle mobilization on day 1. The external fixator was kept for an average of 7 weeks (range 6-8), with 

full weight-bearing resuming after 8-12 weeks.

The final follow-up included clinical and radiographic examinations (anteroposterior and lateral 

ankle radiographs, axial calcaneus views) at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months, as well 

as final follow-up. American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scores were recorded at 

each follow-up. CT scans were performed in all patients at the follow-up.

Statistical Analysis

Statistical analysis using Student’s t-test was performed, and a value of p≤0.05 was considered statis￾tically significant.

RESULTS

In the EF group, the mean AOFAS score at final follow-up was 74.1 (range 37-100). The data showed 

good or excellent outcomes in 50% (6 patients), while two (16.7%) expressed fair results, according to 

AOFAS scores. Six patients (50%) reported good satisfaction, while two (16.7%) expressed fair results.

In the LP group, the mean AOFAS score was 76 (range 55-88), with 75% reporting excellent or good 

results (Table 2). No significant differences in the AOFAS ankle hindfoot scale scores were observed 

between the two groups (p=0.65).

The median preoperative Böhler’s angle was 14.2° (range 1°-32°) in the EF group, and 14.9° 

(range 9°-26°) in the LP group. Postoperative Böhler’s angles were 32.6° (range 20°-58°) and 30.8° 

(range 20°-49°) in the EF and LP groups, respectively, with median increases of 18.9° and 15.9° 

(Figure 5, Table 3). In both groups, improvement of postoperative Böhler’s angle was statistically 

significant (p<0.01)

The median preoperative Gissane’s angle was 130.2° (range 107°-180°) in the EF group, and 129.2° 

(range 104°-180°) in the LP group. Postoperative Gissane’s angles were 115.8° (range 82°-138°) and 

116.9° (range 90°-130°) in the EF and LP groups, respectively (Table 3). In both groups, improvement 

of postoperative Böhler’s angle was statistically significant (p<0.01).

Postoperative complications included one case of algodystrophy in the LP group, resolved with 

clodronic acid and pulsed magnetic field therapy. Three cases of chronic peroneal tendinitis were 

resolved by removing the plate and screws after bone healing, and one patient underwent secondary 

subtalar arthrodesis due to osteoarthritis 3 years after the injury (Figure 6a-c). Only four patients re￾sumed sports activity (two from each treatment group).

DISCUSSION

In 1916, Cotton and Henderson18 emphasized the need for improved outcomes in treating calcaneus 

fractures. Since then, significant advances have been made in the management of intra-articular cal￾caneus fractures19. Despite the introduction of antibiotic therapy, which has helped reduce soft tissue 

complications, wound healing delays are still observed in 25% of patients treated for intra-articular 

calcaneal fractures via the standard lateral approach20.

The extensile lateral approach (ELA) is considered the gold standard for treating these fractures. It 

provides excellent visualization of the fracture site and facilitates accurate anatomic reduction of the 

articular surface. However, the ELA is associated with a high rate of complications, including fracture 

fragment devascularization, larger surgical exposure, wound edge necrosis or infection, and resection 

of the lateral calcaneal branch of the peroneal artery21,22.

Minimally invasive techniques have been developed and promoted as alternatives to the tra￾ditional ELA to minimize soft tissue complications related to the L-shaped incision. These include 

percutaneous fixation (for example, in tongue-type fractures according to the Essex-Lopresti 

Figure 6. a, Preoperative CT scan, man 56 y, (b) CT scan after 30 months, (c) post-operative (secondary subtalar 

arthrodesis) X-ray.

classification), arthroscopically assisted fixation, and minimally invasive surgery (MIS)11,23,24. In 

recent years, several studies have evaluated the medium- and short-term outcomes of these 

approaches.

The use of MIS combined with rigid internal fixation using locking plates is now widely accepted for 

the treatment of most long-bone and periarticular fractures. This technique has been shown to facil￾itate early postoperative mobilization, accelerate rehabilitation, and promote better wound healing, 

thus reducing the incidence of local necrosis and infections25.

However, there are few studies directly comparing the outcomes of ELA and MIS combined 

with rigid internal fixation, and most of these studies involve small sample sizes (15-35 patients). 

Additionally, many studies26 are retrospective, with follow-up periods varying from several months 

to years. AOFAS scores are not included in all studies, and key factors such as time from injury to 

fixation, surgeon experience, incision length, and blood loss are often not reported26,27. Recent 

literature supports the use of MIS combined with rigid internal fixation for Sanders type II and III 

fractures, but fewer studies have examined its use in highly comminuted fractures (type IV in Sand￾ers classification)28.

The sinus tarsi approach is the most frequently used limited lateral approach. In their meta-anal￾ysis, Zhang et al29 demonstrated that the sinus tarsi approach outperforms the ELA with smaller 

incisions, a lower incidence of wound healing complications, and a reduced postoperative VAS 

score. Moreover, alignment on lateral radiographs and the excellent-to-good rates according to the 

AOFAS score were not negatively impacted.

In 2022, Wallace et al27 described one hundred and five fractures in 100 patients treated with 

the sinus tarsi approach for intra-articular calcaneal fractures. The wound complication rate was 

11.9%, with 1.9% requiring additional procedures. 

According to many authors30-32, external fixation is typically indicated for the emergency treat￾ment of open calcaneal fractures or closed fractures with severe soft tissue compromise. A few 

studies33,34 have explored percutaneous reduction and external fixation as definitive treatments for 

articular calcaneal fractures, irrespective of soft tissue concerns.

In 2006, Magnan et al35 described the treatment of 54 intra-articular fractures with a mini-fix￾ator, reporting good-to-excellent outcomes in 96.7% of patients. They observed three cases of 

thalamic displacement due to early weight bearing. In 2024, Checa-Betegon et al33 treated 42 in￾tra-articular calcaneus fractures with external fixator, reporting a mean postoperative AOFAS score 

of 79.1. Van Hoeve and Poeze36 conducted a review in 2016 evaluating outcomes after treatment 

with percutaneous and minimally invasive open techniques for calcaneal fractures. They found that 

percutaneous reduction and screw osteosynthesis, along with minimally invasive open techniques, 

resulted in significantly better outcomes (based on AOFAS scores and improvements in Bohler’s 

angle) compared to external fixation and other methods such as K-wire fixation. They also noted 

a higher infection rate in the external fixation group due to more frequent pin-tract infections36.

The primary goals of treatment are to restore the calcaneus’s three-dimensional structure 

(height, length, and width), reconstruct the subtalar joint, decompress the sub-peroneal area 

(avoiding peroneal conflict), reduce the calcaneocuboid surface, and align the calcaneal tuberosity 

in its physiological position.

In our experience, minimally invasive surgery has proven effective in achieving these objectives. 

Both external and internal fixation via the sinus tarsi approach have successfully restored the cal￾caneal height and increased the Bohler’s angle (Figure 5). According to the literature, the wound 

complication rate is lower with both minimally invasive techniques15,20,27,37,38.

Veltman et al39 analyzed long-term outcomes (mean follow-up 4.6 years) for 1,730 intra-artic￾ular calcaneal fractures. The average AOFAS score was 73.7 (range: 63 to 92), consistent with the 

findings of our study. The authors considered external fixation a good alternative for definitive 

treatment of intra-articular calcaneal fractures, with functional outcomes comparable to internal 

fixation, excluding concerns related to nursing and patient compliance.

This study has several limitations: the small sample size and the lack of randomization are the 

most significant.

CONCLUSIONS

MIS techniques yield results comparable to those of open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), with 

the advantages of shorter waiting times, better soft tissue preservation, and reduced complication 

9 MINIMALLY INVASIVE TREATMENT OF CALCANEUS FRACTURE

rates23-25. Both internal and external fixation provide excellent outcomes for the treatment of Sanders 

type II and III fractures. The choice between the two approaches should be guided by the surgeon’s 

experience and the specific clinical scenario.

Abstract

Introduction The Achilles tendon is the strongest tendon in the human body and has the function of plantar ankle flexion. 

When the tendon is exposed, the peritendineum has been breached and the thick avascular tendon colonized with bacteria, 

a complete resection of the tendon may be indicated to achieve infection control and facilitate wound closure. The Achilles 

tendon reconstruction is not mandatory, as the plantar flexion of the ankle joint is assumed by the remaining flexor hallucis 

longus, flexor digitorum longus and tibialis posterior muscles. Our study aimed to evaluate the impact of Achilles tendon 

resection without reconstruction on leg function and quality of life.

Material and methods We retrospectively evaluated all patients who were treated with an Achilles tendon resection between 

January 2017 and June 2022 in our quaternary institution. After evaluating the data, the patients who survived and were not 

amputated were contacted for re-evaluation, which included isokinetic strength measurement of both ankle joints, evaluation 

of the ankle range of motion and collection of several functional scores.

Results Thirty patients were included in the retrospective study, with a mean age of 70.3 years, including 11 women and 19 

men. The most frequent cause of the infection was leg ulcer (43.3%), followed by open tendon suture (23.3%). No tendon 

reconstruction was performed. Fifteen patients could be gained for reevaluation. The average difference in ankle flexion torque 

on the injured side compared to the healthy side at 30 degrees/second was 57.49% (p=0.003) and at 120 degrees/second was 

53.13% (p=0.050) while the difference in power was 45.77% (p=0.025) at 30 degrees/second and 38.08% (p=0.423) at 120 

degrees/second. The follow-up time was between 4 and 49 months and a positive correlation could be determined between the 

time elapsed from surgery and the ankle joint strength. There was a significant loss of range of motion on the operated side 

compared to the healthy side: 37.30% for plantar flexion, 24.56% for dorsal extension, 27.79% for pronation and 24.99% for 

supination. The average Lepillhati Score was 68.33, while the average American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score was 74.53.

Conclusion The complete Achilles tendon resection leaves the patient with satisfactory leg function and an almost normal gait. 

Especially in elderly, multimorbid patients, straightforward tendon resection and wound closure provide fast infection control 

with acceptable long-term results. Further prospective studies should compare the ankle function and gait in patients with and 

without Achilles tendon reconstruction after complete resection.

Background

The Achilles tendon (AT) is the strongest in the human 

body. Its contributing muscles are the medial and the lat￾eral gastrocnemius and the soleus muscles, which together 

form the triceps surae muscle [1]. The AT function is plantar 

flexion of the ankle joint. As opposed to the mythological 

figure Achilles, the AT is not of vital importance to humans 

and when resected, the flexor hallucis longus (FHL), flexor

digitorum longus (FDL) and tibialis posterior muscles can 

take over its function and act as plantar flexors of the ankle 

joint [3].

Because the AT lies superficial, without muscle coverage, 

it can easily become exposed and infected. Blunt or sharp 

trauma, corticoid infiltration, surgical repair (Fig. 1b), leg 

ulcers (Fig. 1a) and other dermatological disorders asso￾ciated with skin necrosis, all can lead to the infection of 

the tendon [4]. Early debridement and removal of necrotic 

tissues, foreign bodies, suture material and bone anchors 

are prerequisites to infection control [5]. Once the peri￾tendineum has been breached and the thick avascular tendon 

becomes imbibed with water and colonized with bacteria, a 

complete resection of the tendon may be indicated to achieve 

infection control and facilitate wound closure [3, 4, 6].

After surgical debridement with radical Achilles tendon 

resection (ATR), efficient wound closure is necessary [7]. As 

many of these patients are multimorbid with tissue perfusion 

disorders of the lower extremities, a straightforward solution 

like direct skin suture or split-thickness skin grafting is often 

preferable to a complex free tissue transfer procedure with 

concomitant tendon reconstruction [4]. The goal of our study 

was to evaluate the residual function of the ankle joint and 

the quality of life in patients after Achilles tendon resection. 

So far there is to our knowledge only one publication in 

the literature, which evaluates the function of seven patients 

after ATR.

Material and methods

We retrospectively gathered the data from all patients who 

were treated with an Achilles tendon resection between 

January 2017 and June 2022 in our quaternary care institu￾tion. After evaluating the data, the patients who survived 

and were not amputated were contacted for the second 

part of the study. Six patients (20%) died in the meantime 

(Table 1), six patients refused to take part in the study and 

one patient could not be reached. Fifteen patients could pre￾sent themselves in our clinic for the study. After signing the

informed consent, the patients were clinically examined and 

three ankle and hindfoot specific scores were ascertained: 

the Achilles Tendon Total Rupture Score (ATRS), which 

includes 10 questions for the patient to answer, the American 

Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS), a commonly 

used score which combines a patient-reported and a cli￾nician-reported part, and the Leppilhati Score, which is 

composed from 5 subjective and 2 objective questions. 

1247 Archives of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery (2024) 144:1243–1257

Furthermore, two more scores were collected:the Visual 

Analog Scale (VAS), where the patients report their level of 

pain on a scala from 0 to 10 and the EuroQol 5Dscore, where 

the patients evaluate their quality of life and health status.. 

The range of motion of both ankle joints was measured 

(plantar flexion/dorsal extension and pronation/supination). 

An isokinetic strength measurement of both ankle joints 

was performed, using an angular velocity of 30 degrees per 

second (°/s) and 120°/s with the device IsoMed 2000® (D. 

& R. Ferstl GmbH, Hemau, Germany) (Fig. 2). Two meas￾urements were performed, each with three repetitions. The 

better of the two measurements was used and an average 

was made from the three obtained values. One patient had 

a poor general condition and could not perform the force 

measurement. Another patient could perform all the meas￾urements, except for the 120°/s on the operated leg. The 

average follow-up time was 19 months (4–49 months).

The data were gathered in Excel 365 (Microsoft Corpo￾ration, WA, USA). For the statistical analysis JASP version 

0.16.4 (University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands) was 

used. Normal distribution was tested with the Shapiro–Wilk 

test. Numerical non-matched variables were tested with the 

t-test if normally distributed or with the Mann–Whitney 

U-test otherwise. For matched dependent variables, the Wil￾coxon signed-rank test was used. Categorical variables were 

compared using Fisher´s Exact test. Correlations were ana￾lyzed using Pearson’s correlation coefficient for normal dis￾tributed variables, while for the non-normal distributed vari￾ables Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient was employed. 

Statistical significance was considered when p<0.05.

The study was approved by the institutional review board 

(BO-EK-196032021). A signed informed consent was 

obtained for the reevaluation.

Radical ATR—operative technique

The indication for ATR is given when the exposed Achil￾les tendon with breached peritendineum shows imbibi￾tion either clinically or by MRI. A failed wound closure 

with infection relapse or bone involvement also indicates 

an ATR. The surgery is performed in supine position or 

lateral decubitus, with the diseased leg lying on top of the 

healthy one. Regional anesthesia is preferred whenever 

possible. The incision encompasses the existing wound 

and extends along the posterior midline upwards until the 

tendon–muscle junction is reached and downwards to the 

Tuber calcanei. The AT is prepared bluntly and luxated 

from its compartment (Fig. 3c). Using a scalpel, the tendon 

is resected from the calcaneal bone at its insertion. If a bone 

involvement has been diagnosed, the Tuber calcanei can 

now be resected with a chisel, in one piece with the tendon 

(Fig. 3a, b, d). Cranially the tendon is resected at the point 

where it spreads into the aponeurosis. The resected speci￾men (Fig. 3e, f) is sent to histopathological examination. 

Microbiological probes are harvested from the wound, after 

which irrigation and hemostasis are performed, followed by 

wound closure, especially of the proximal and distal wounds 

(Fig. 3g). If direct wound closure is not feasible, negative 

pressure wound therapy (NPWT) with 125 mmHg is initi￾ated. After infection control and wound stabilization, the 

wound can be closed either by split-thickness skin grafting 

(STSG), predicted or free flaps.

Results

Thirty patients with an average age of 70.3 (63–87) years 

were included in the study. There were 11 women and 19 

men in the cohort. The average body mass index (BMI) 

was 27.24 (standard deviation (SD) 5.97). Considering the 

comorbidities, most of the patients had arterial hyperten￾sion (80%), followed by diabetes mellitus (46.67%), obe￾sity (30%) and peripheral artery disease (PAD) (10%). The 

American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status clas￾sification (ASA) was two in five patients, three in 23 patients 

and four in two patients. The right leg was involved in 43.3% 

(n=13) patients, the left leg in 50.0% (n=15) patients and 

6.6% (n=2) patients had a bilateral lesion. Two patients 

were amputated during the inpatient treatment, both having 

advanced peripheral arterial disease without improvement 

after minimally invasive intervention.

The time elapsed from the first diagnosis of Achilles ten￾don infection (ATI) until the admission to our clinic was 

75.4 (0–1263) days. All patients finally received a complete 

resection of the AT, whereby in 71.88% (n=23) cases the 

tendon was resected at the first surgery and in the remaining 

28.13% (n=9) during the following surgeries. The complete 

en bloc resection of AT (Fig. 3c–f) was performed in 62.5% 

(n=20) of the cases, while the rest 37.5% (n=12) received a 

gradual resection in several surgeries. When possible, partial 

retention of AT was intended, which was often not feasible 

due to the extended infection of the tendon. The patients 

were operated on average 4.94 times (2–13, SD 2.27).

When analyzing the etiology of the open wound which 

led to the ATI, we found 13 patients (43.3%) to have a 

chronic leg ulcer, six patients (20%) had received an open 

AT repair, another six patients had chronic wounds after 

minor trauma and the remaining five patients (16.7%) had 

traumatic degloving, resection of a squamous cell carcinoma 

(Fig. 3), pressure sore and two Pyoderma gangrenosum. Five 

patients had an associated osteomyelitis of the calcaneus.

Considering the closure technique, four wounds could be 

closed primarily, 23 wounds were treated with NPWT and 

STSG, two patients received a free latissimus dorsi flap and 

STSG (Fig. 4) and one patient received a free anterolateral 

thigh perforator flap (ALT) (Fig. 5). No ATR was attempted. 

In the 28 patients where the legs could be saved, 14 wounds 

were completely closed at discharge and 12 patients had 

small residual wounds (<1 cm), which healed ambulatory. 

Two patients were discharged with larger residual wounds 

(>1 cm) and received further outpatient wound care. The 

treatment time in our clinic was on average 37.8 days (6–95, 

SD 21,47).

The re-evaluation was performed on 14 patients, with 

a mean follow-up time of 19  months (4–49, SD 12.6). 

Using the IsoMed 2000® device, two examinations were 

performed, each with three repetitions. After choosing the 

better values from the two examinations, an average was 

made from the values of the three repetitions. Finally, we 

obtained values for the absolute maximum torque in Nm 

and the power in Watt, which were statistically evaluated. 

As expected, the absolute maximum torque was attenu￾ated on the operated side compared to the healthy side, not 

only for the ankle flexion, but also for the extension. The 

30°/s measurement showed the greatest difference, with 

an average loss in flexion torque of 57.49% on the injured 

side (p=0.003) and an average loss in extension torque of 

33.81% (p=0.069) compared to the healthy side. With the 

120°/s measurement the differences between the sides were 

less pronounced, with a loss in torque on the operated side 

of 53.13% (p=0.05) for flexion and 32.55% (p=0.075) for 

extension compared to the healthy side (Fig. 6a).

The loss in power on the operated side compared to the 

healthy side for flexion at 30°/s was 45.77% (p=0.025) and 

at 120°/s was 68.81% (p=0.423), while for an extension 

at 30°/s the residual power was on average 6.63% more on 

the injured side than on the healthy side (p=0.877), while 

at 120°/s the power was 68.81% less on the injured side 

(p=0.292) (Fig. 6b).

As the follow-up time ranged from 4 to 49 months, we 

searched for a correlation between the time elapsed from sur￾gery and ankle joint strength. We found a tendency toward 

the reduction of strength difference between the operated 

and healthy sides, for flexion and extension, although with￾out a statistical significance (Fig. 7a–d).

The age of the re-evaluated patients varied between 63 

and 87 years old. We analyzed the relation between the age 

of the patient and the strength of the ankle joint flexion and 

found that the loss in torque on the injured side increases 

with age at 30°/s (p=0.001) and 120°/s (p=0.009) (Fig. 8a). 

This correlation was weaker when analyzing the loss in 

power at 30°/s (p=0.242) and 120°/s (p=0.839) (Fig. 8b).

Three women and 11 men presented for reevaluation. We 

compared the difference in strength between the two sexes 

and found that men had less torque and power loss with flex￾ion in the injured leg and had on average more strength with 

extension in the injured leg than the healthy side (Fig. 9a, 

b). Considering the smaller female group (three patients), 

statistical significance could not be evaluated.

There was a statistically significant loss of range of 

motion on the operated side compared to the healthy side: 

37.30% (22.33° vs 14°), for plantar flexion (p= 0.003), 

24.56% (17.67° vs13.33° for dorsal extension (p=0.014), 

27.79% (24° vs 17.33°) for pronation (p = 0.002), and 

24.99% (21.33 vs 16°) for supination (p=0.037) (Fig. 10a). 

When considering the follow-up time, the flexion and supi￾nation showed an improvement with elapsed time, while the 

extension and pronation showed a deterioration, without sta￾tistical significance (Fig. 10b, c).

Table 1 depicts the raised functional scores. There was 

a trend toward better functional scores with longer follow￾up times (Fig. 11a) and a trend toward worse functional 

scores with growing age (Fig. 11b), without statistical sig￾nificance. The gait was evaluated within the AOFAS score. 

Five patients had a normal gait, seven patients could walk 

almost normally with walking support and three patients 

needed a wheelchair to cover longer distances. The patients 

with normal gait had less strength difference between the 

legs and were younger.

Discussion

In this study, we could show that the radical resection of the 

infected AT leads to control of the infection and successful 

wound closure. A satisfying residual function in the ankle 

joint remains, which offers the patients a good quality of life.

We could show in 30 patients that ATI is a serious com￾plication that can have dramatic consequences if not appro￾priately treated. Although many practitioners are reserved 

in sacrificing the AT, we showed that the advantages of 

achieving infection control and wound closure outweigh the 

functional impairment. Especially in older, morbid patients, 

prompt AT resection and direct or STSG wound closure may 

save the patient’s limb and even life.

The functional evaluation showed that a significant drop 

in torque and power for plantar flexion occurs on the injured 

leg compared to the healthy side. Furthermore, there was 

a loss in extension torque and power on the injured side. 

This could reflect on one hand a functional disbalance of 

the leg flexors and extensors but on the other side, it could 

also reflect the prolonged treatment in these patients, which 

implied reduced mobility with muscle atrophy and func￾tion loss. The evaluation according to the follow-up time 

showed a trend toward strength improvement, which could 

be explained by the muscle hypertrophy in the deep poste￾rior muscle compartment but also by the rehabilitation and 

physical exercise which led to improved mobility and gait. 

We could also show that the patient’s age is an important 

factor for functional recovery. The younger the patient, the 

better the expected result. Considering all these data, we 

can conclude that the outcomes are more than satisfying in 

a cohort aged 70.3 years on average. The scores confirm the 

good functional results while showing a low residual pain 

level. The lower EurQol score of 55 from 100 reflects not 

only the leg function but also the general condition of the 

patient due to their age and comorbidities.

Situated in a superficial position, the AT is easily exposed 

when the skin and the subcutaneous tissues are breached. 

This may happen through sharp trauma, leg ulcers due 

to vascular impairment (venous, arterial, mixed), skin

necrosis due to pressure, friction, infection, dermatologi￾cal diseases or iatrogenic after open AT repair[3, 4, 8]. The 

peritendineum offers nutrition and protection to the volu￾minous bradytroph tendon tissue [1]. When this sheath is 

breached, the contamination of the tendinous tissue needs 

to be promptly addressed to save the tendon. Especially 

foreign bodies, including suture material and bony fixa￾tion devices, form a biofilm and sustain the infection and 

therefore need to be promptly debrided and removed [5]. 

The development of NPWT has dramatically improved the 

treatment of chronic wounds and is a valuable tool in closing 

leg wounds and preserving the injured AT [5]. The percu￾taneous AT repair offers the advantage of maintaining the 

synovial blood supply while avoiding the problematic wound 

over the tendon. Studies have shown that this technique may 

reduce the incidence of wound complications and AT infec￾tions [9]. Despite all these surgical advances, the exposed 

AT may become imbibed and diffusely contaminated, at 

which point a complete resection is not avoidable. In these 

situations, a partial AT resection would leave contaminated 

necrotic tissue in place and maintain the infection indefi￾nitely. Especially in elderly, multimorbid patients, this can 

have dramatic consequences, including abscess formation, 

necrotizing fasciitis, limb loss and even death (Fig. 4a, 4b). 

The radical debridement must include, therefore, all the 

necrotic tissues, the whole contaminated tendinous tissue, 

all the foreign bodies, including bone anchors and possibly 

the necrotic bone fragments in the calcaneus (Fig. 5a, b, c). 

If calcaneus osteomyelitis is diagnosed in the MRI, then a 

six-week antibiotic cure should be initiated.

There are different ways for ATR. If there is no soft tis￾sue defect, an FHL tendon transfer can be performed. This 

changes the insertion of the FHL from the base of the distal 

phalanx of the hallux to the distal Achilles tendon or Tuber 

calcanei. In a study on 11 patients with chronic AT rupture 

treated with FHL tendon transfer, Wegrzyn et al. found a loss 

of torque of 28±11% at 30°/s and 36±4% at 120°/s com￾pared to the opposite side at 79 months average follow-up 

[10]. A similar solution is the transfer of the peroneus brevis 

tendon, with comparable results to the FHL tendon transfer 

[11, 12]. Another alternative is the FDL tendon transfer, 

whereas no studies are comparing it with the FHL transfer 

[5]. One should consider nevertheless that these techniques 

can be associated with wound healing complications [11], 

that tendon transfer with suture material and possibly bone 

anchors suppose a high infection risk in a septic situation 

and should be avoided whenever possible and that the final 

loss of flexion strength is not negligible. Tendon autografts, 

allografts, xenografts or synthetic grafts can also be used to 

bridge the tendon gap [11]. The prerequisite is nevertheless 

a closed wound without bacterial contamination. In septic 

cases, a vascularized tendon transfer is preferred to avoid 

infection relapse, loss of graft and development of osteo￾myelitis [4].

If there is a soft tissue defect, a plastic surgeon should be 

involved. While classically the so-called reconstructive lad￾der has been applied, where the surgeon gradually deploys 

the simplest available solution for wound closure [4], the 

modern plastic surgery flap employs the reconstructive 

elevator [13] or clockwork [14], where the most appropri￾ate combination of reconstructive techniques is applied to 

achieve an optimal result. In AT septic surgery, closure with 

remote tissue containing a vascularized tendon would be the 

ideal solution. This brings well-vascularized soft tissue and 

tendon for wound healing as well as robust skin and subcu￾taneous tissue to resist the shear forces in this area and avoid 

inducing more trauma through the donor site to an already 

injured leg. Several factors have to be taken into consid￾eration like comorbidities, local vessel status and patient 

availability to sustain prolonged surgery and rehabilitation, 

before taking the reconstructive elevator straight to the high￾est floor, free flaps.

In elderly, multimorbid patients, like in our cohort, a 

swift, uncomplicated wound closure might serve the best 

patient. Therefore, after achieving infection control and a 

clean wound, the direct closure over drainages or STSG with 

additive NPWT might best serve the goal [5]. A troublesome 

region is the tuber calcanei, which usually can be closed 

directly after tendon resection. If this is not the case and 

the bone is exposed, prolonged NPWT with the addition of 

dermal substitutes may help achieve a granulating wound for 

skin transfer. When the calcaneal bone has been debrided 

and is exposed, a free flap might nevertheless remain the 

only option for limb salvage (Fig. 5 a–j). The main disad￾vantage of skin grafting is that the scar tissue is prone to 

breakdown due to friction with clothing and footwear, so 

careful long-time scar care is necessary. Also, a secondary 

tendon reconstruction would be difficult after split thick￾ness skin grafting. Fourniols et al. published a series of 15 

ATI with radical AT resection and secondary wound healing. 

Although they report good results and the formation of a 

neo-tendon on MRI due to the scar tissue, the mean wound 

closure time was 61 days [6].

Local flaps are a straightforward solution. The distally 

based fasciocutaneous sural flap is a common solution for 

covering the AT. It offers abundant, thin tissue with effort￾less dissection. The donor site morbidity, lack of available 

vascularized tendon and the relatively high complication 

rate of 26.4%, especially in the elderly and in patients with 

venous insufficiency render it a backup solution in our prac￾tice [15–17].

Free flaps play a key role in ATR. Out of the fasciocu￾taneous flaps, the lateral arm flap, harvested with a strip 

of triceps tendon [23], the radial forearm flap with flexor

carpi radialis tendon [24], the infragluteal flap[25], the ten￾sor fascia lata flap [26] and ALT flap [27, 28], both har￾vested with a vascularized strip of fascia lata offer healthy 

well-vascularized soft tissue and tendon which can improve 

the healing of a chronically infected, poorly vascularized 

wound. In a systematic review, Iorio et al. report on 44 ATR 

with free composite grafts from 15 studies, out of which 30 

vascularized tendon reconstructions and 7 avascular recon￾structions. The average age of the patients was 33 years and 

the etiology of the defect was trauma, spontaneous tendon 

rupture and tumor resection. Only 50% of the patients had an 

infection. They found an average strength deficit of 32.3% at 

30 to 60°/s and 31.5% at 120°/s for vascularized tendons and 

21.2% and 24.8% for avascular ATR. The ROM was 80% for 

vascularized and 82% for avascular reconstructions from the 

contralateral side [29].

Free muscle flaps have also been employed in ATR. 

While the latissimus dorsi flap is ideal for covering extended 

leg wounds (Fig. 4h, i), the fibrosing of the muscle may 

transform it into a tendon-like structure [30].

Our cohort’s average age was 70.3 years, with a high 

incidence of comorbidities. Although we found no asso￾ciation between the patient-related and surgery-related 

risk factors and the functional outcome, most of these 

patients had a diminished general condition even before 

the Achilles tendon resection. As the patients were already 

hospitalized when they were admitted to our institution, 

the activities of daily living could not be evaluated before 

the treatment. The ASA scores, the comorbidities and 

the 20% mortality between discharge and the study begin 

reflect nevertheless the patients’ general condition. The 

postoperative functional values of 50–60% strength loss 

and 25–35% ROM loss compared to the healthy side were 

comparable to the values reached after tendon reconstruc￾tion, especially if we consider the patients’ age and func￾tional demands.

in our group. Gender should also be considered when plan￾ning treatment strategies [31].

Boorboor et al. published in 2006 the only study so far 

about the remaining function after Achilles tendon resec￾tion [3]. They evaluated seven patients, two females and five 

males, who received a radical resection of the Achilles ten￾don without reconstruction. The infection complicated the 

open tendon suture in five cases and two cases were caused 

by leg ulcers. They used similar wound closure techniques 

as in our study, including direct suture, STSG and local and 

free flaps. The follow-up time was on average 11.4 months 

(5–25), shorter than 19 months in our study. The findings 

showed an acceptable to good gait function, with a loss in 

ROM on the operated side compared to the healthy side 

of 9° on average for dorsal extension and plantar flexion 

and of 16° on average for pronation and supination, values 

comparable to our study. The average AOFAS Score was 

84.7, higher than in our study. This could be attributed to 

the smaller size of the cohort and the average age of the 

patients, 57.3 compared to 70.3 years in our study. The 

isokinetic strength measurements were performed at 60°/s, 

120°/s and 180°/s. They found a loss of torque on the oper￾ated side compared to the healthy side of 42% at 120°/s com￾pared to 53.13% at 120°/s in our study. Likewise, the loss of 

power at 120°/s was 37.2% compared to 38.08% at 120°/s 

in our study. Considering the differences in the cohorts, we 

could conclude from both studies that the remaining ankle 

flexion strength is between 40 and 50% from the healthy 

side, whereas age and comorbidities play an important role. 

The dorsal extension showed in their study an increase in 

torque and power, whereas our patients showed on average 

a decrease in these values. In addition to our work, they 

could perform a postoperative MRI on three patients, which 

confirmed the expectations that the triceps surae muscle 

atrophies, while the muscles from the deep posterior com￾partment hypertrophy.

The results of our study are limited and are relevant espe￾cially for the elderly patients with multiple comorbidities, 

which is also the population who usually develops an AT 

infection. The patients were recruited after the treatment was 

over, which is a limitation of the study, while the functional 

reexamination of the patients was performed in a prospective 

manner. A direct comparison between AT resection with and 

without tendon reconstruction could not be performed in our 

study and should be the goal of future studies, preferably in 

a prospective setting.

Conclusion

In the case of an AT infection, the surgeon should thor￾oughly evaluate the risk–benefit ratio for the patient. As 

most of these conditions occur in multimorbid patients, the 

radical resection of the tendon with straightforward wound 

closure appears to be the optimal option. We could show in 

the current study that the complete ATR leaves the patient 

with an acceptable leg function and an almost normal gate 

while ensuring infection control and enabling wound heal￾ing. Considering the satisfactory functional results and 

quality of life, one would expect that most patients will be 

satisfied with the outcome and not wish for further treat￾ment. If nevertheless, the active patient should wish a further 

functional improvement, the FHL transfer or an avascular or 

vascularized tendon graft may be performed after definitive 

wound healing, without the high risk of infection relapse in 

the acute situation. According to the current evidence, the 

patient needs nevertheless to be informed that the expected 

improvement is not substantial and that a 20–40% functional 

deficit will persist, compared to the healthy side. Hereof, 

further prospective studies should compare the ankle func￾tion and gait in patients with and without Achilles tendon 

reconstruction after complete resection.

Abstract

Background: A fracture of the calcaneus can be a painful and disabling injury. Treatment modalities may be

conservative or operative. Surgical treatment strategies include open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF)

techniques, as well as a variety of minimally invasive methods. The aim of this study was to evaluate the treatment

options and post-treatment complication rates for intra-articular calcaneal fractures at the Traumacenter Linz over a

9-year period.

Methods: All patients with calcaneal fractures treated at the Traumacenter Linz between 2007 and 2015 were

included in this study. The patients records were retrospectively reviewed, and the data, including demographic

parameters, cause of injury, and the time between injury and operative treatment were analyzed. The number of

secondary operative interventions due to soft-tissue complications, hardware removal, and the long-term

arthrodesis rate were evaluated.

Results: A minimally invasive 2-point-distractor method was used in 85.8% (n = 182) of all operatively managed

calcaneal fractures (n = 212) in our department. The majority of the operations (88.7%) were performed within 2

days after the accident. The secondary operation rate resulting from wound complications was 2.7% in the 2-point

distractor group and 16.7% in the ORIF group. A secondary arthrodesis was performed in 4.7% (n = 9) of the

subtalar joints in the entire study population.

Conclusions: Our data supported the assumption that severe wound complications would be less likely to occur

after minimally invasive treatment compared to ORIF treatment. The rate of secondary arthrodesis in the study

cohort was comparable to that in the literature.

Level of evidence: IV

Background

A calcaneal fracture can be a painful and disabling injury.

Fractures of the heel bone account for about 2% of all

fractures, and are often intra-articular, multi-fragmentary,

and comminuted. Standardized treatment protocols are

lacking, and the optimal treatment of intra-articular calca￾neal fractures is still controversial. Multiple factors such

as fracture pattern, comorbidities, timing, and status of

the soft tissue must be considered [1–3].

Treatment modalities vary between conservative, open

reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), numerous min￾imally invasive approaches, and even primary subtalar

joint arthrodesis [4–6].

Prolonged and eventful healing or mal-reduction of

the fracture can lead to poor results and a persistent dis￾ability [1, 3]. The goal of operative management is to re￾trieve an anatomically correct reduction of the joint

surfaces and a reconstruction of the length, width,

height, and axis of the calcaneus. However, an anatomic

reconstruction cannot always be achieved in severely

comminuted fractures [6, 7]. An optimal treatment

should minimize operative soft tissue dissection, which

reduces the risk of wound dehiscence and does not com￾promise potentially necessary surgical procedures in ad￾jacent tissues [3, 8]. If a secondary arthrodesis of the

subtalar joint is required later on, the procedure is gen￾erally easier to perform after a previous minimally inva￾sive procedure. This will lead to a better clinical result

since the calcaneal axis has already been corrected, and

the bone stock has been remodeled [5, 9].

Accounting for the advantages of operative treatment

in general, and minimally invasive treatment in particu￾lar, we implemented a treatment protocol in our depart￾ment and standardized the operative technique from

positioning to X-ray views, repositioning and osteo￾synthesis, and postoperative care.

The aim of this study was to evaluate this treatment

protocol and the subsequent complication rate in the

management of intra-articular calcaneal fractures over a

9-year period. Herein, we also describe our operative

techniques and protocol for the management of open or

closed calcaneal fractures (see Additional file 1).

Methods

Study design and participants

A retrospective data-analysis was performed on the data

of 298 patients at the Traumacenter Linz, Austria. Be￾tween 1/1/2007 and 1/1/2016, patients with uni- or bi￾lateral, open or closed calcaneal fractures, treated

operatively or conservatively with a follow-up of at least

12 months were included in the study. Patients were an￾alyzed using data extracted from the medical documen￾tation system of the Austrian Social Insurance for

Occupational Risks (AUVA).

Demographic data, cause of injury, time from injury to

surgery, treatment modality, need for revision surgery,

and complications were analyzed.

Complications

Complications were defined as postoperative wound

healing problems that required revision surgery, un￾planned hardware removal due to irritation of the soft

tissue, or the need for a subtalar arthrodesis. An elective

hardware removal was not considered to be a complica￾tion. Elective hardware removal procedures were per￾formed with the intention to avoid interference with a

potential arthrodesis in the future or on an explicit re￾quest from the patient.

Statistical analysis

Descriptive statistics, including means and standard de￾viations (SDs) for continuous variables (age, time from

accident to operative intervention) and frequency counts

for categorical variables (sex, treatment modality, trauma

mechanism, operative technique, infectious complica￾tions, number of implant removals, cases necessitating

secondary subtalar arthrodesis) were calculated. Chi￾square analyses were used as appropriate to determine

whether there were differences between the two surgi￾cally treated groups. All statistical analyses were per￾formed using SPSS statistical software (version 23, SPSS

Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA), and p < .05 indicated a sta￾tistically significant result.

Results

Demographics

From 2007 to 2015, a total of 298 patients with calca￾neal fractures treated at the Traumacenter Linz were

identified. Of these, 236 were men (79.2%) and 62

were women (20.8%). In total, 212 patients (71.1%)

were treated operatively, and 86 patients (28.9%) were

treated conservatively. Patient age at the time of in￾jury ranged from 15 to 82 years. The mean age was

45.7 (range, 15–79) years, and 44.2 (range, 7–94)

years in the operatively and conservatively treated

groups, respectively. Details see Table 1.

Trauma mechanism

The most common injuries were ground-level falls

(29%), occurring mostly in elderly female patients. Falls

from a height of more than two meters occurred in 30%

of cases, mostly in young male patients. External trauma,

such as motor vehicle accidents, occurred in 33% of

these patients.

Operative technique

The operative technique is given to supplement this art￾icle. Within the 9-year period, 212 patients were

Rodemund et al. BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders (2020) 21:753 Page 2 of 8

operatively treated at the Traumacenter Linz, and the

majority were treated using the 2-point distraction

method (182 patients, 85.8%); a patient case is dis￾played in Fig. 1. Only seven patients were treated

with ORIF (3.3%). K-wire fixations, or combinations

of plates and K-wires with or without utilizing the 2-

point distractor were performed on 23 patients

(10.8%). The annual distribution of the operative

techniques is presented in Table 2.

Time from accident to operative intervention

The operative interventions were performed within the

first 2 days after injury in 88.7% of the patients. Most pa￾tients, who underwent surgery later than 2 days post￾injury (3–14 days) were transferred from other hospitals

or had multiple injuries resulting in a delayed treatment

of their calcaneal fractures.

Complications

Due to the low number of patients that underwent

ORIF, their data were pooled with that of the group

treated with K-wires or a combination of K-wires and

plates (30 patients) to compare with the minimally inva￾sive operations group (182 patients).

In total, wound complications that required revision

occurred in 4.7% (10 patients). Five out of 182 patients

in the minimally invasive group (2.7%), and 5 out of 30

patients in the other two surgically treated groups

(16.7%) sustained a post-operative infection (chi-square

statistic = 11.1; p = 0.000862). Specifics see Table 3.

Unplanned hardware removals due to irritation of the

soft tissue or adjacent joints were performed in 4.2% of

the study population. The secondary subtalar arthrodesis

rate was 4.7% in the whole collective at the time of the

data analysis (June 2017; at least 1 year follow-up). The

overall secondary arthrodesis rates did not change over

the time period of 9 years while the 2-point distraction

method was implemented gradually at the study site. No

primary arthrodesis was performed. Elective hardware

removals were performed in 34.9% of all patients due to

subjective irritation of the screws, at patient request, or

under the consideration that a secondary subtalar arth￾rodesis could interfere with the arthrodesis. The susten￾taculum screw was left in situ in almost 90% of the

patients. An overview of the performed implant re￾movals and secondary subtalar fusions is presented in

Table 4.

The rate of unplanned revision surgeries between 2007

and 2010 was higher (7.3%) than that in the 2011–2015

period (1.7%). The rate of elective hardware removal be￾tween 2007 and 2010 was 41.7% compared to 29.3% be￾tween 2011 and 2015. The authors hypothesize, that

these numbers can be attributed to the increasing ex￾perience with the minimally invasive technique and the

modification of screw positioning.

Discussion

We have modified and standardized the technique of

minimally invasive operative treatment of intra-articular

calcaneal fractures using the 2-point distractor through

changes in positioning of the patient, intraoperative

radiological viewing, screw placement adjustments, and

postoperative care. We believe that this technique

should be preferred over ORIF. The main advantage of

this technique is the reduced rate of wound complica￾tions (2.7%) compared to ORIF (16.7%) in our study

population (p < 0.01). Another important benefit is the

possibility of performing the procedure immediately

without waiting for consolidation of the soft tissue. This

primarily affects the patient since an immediate oper￾ation reduces the pressure on the soft tissue and conse￾quently reduces the level of pain, and it is also of

socioeconomic interest as the duration of hospitalization

is reduced due to less post-operative swelling. Last but

not least, the overall arthrodesis rate of 4.7% at the

Traumacenter Linz is comparable to the literature, al￾though we treat all types of fracture morphologies via

minimally invasive means, regardless of the amount of

comminution. Also, if necessary, a secondary arthrodesis

is technically easier to perform after minimally invasive

procedures.

Many studies have been published concerning the op￾timal method of treating intra-articular calcaneal frac￾tures [1–3, 6, 8, 10–14]. Most of them lacked a

representative number of patients, and therefore, a gen￾eral consensus is still undetermined [1, 2, 13].

At the Traumacenter Linz, the demographic analysis

revealed relatively young patients (mean 43.3 years)

which reflects the high socioeconomic influence of

this fracture occurrence. Also, there is a male pre￾dominance of 3.8:1 in the study cohort. Causes of

falls from heights are the most likely causes of injur￾ies [15]. Contrary, Alexandridis et al. [16] and Bohl

et al. [17] reported a lower incidence of falls, but a

higher rate of traffic accidents (49%).

Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) has been

the preferred therapy for intra-articular fractures in re￾cent decades [1, 2]. The generally accepted approach for

visualization of the fracture site is the extended L￾shaped lateral approach, which is considered the gold

standard [1]. Independent of the approach in ORIF, a

consolidation of the soft tissues is recommended [2,

5, 18]. However, it can take 2–4 weeks before the so￾called “wrinkle-sign” occurs and swelling decreases [2,

5]. Al-Mudhaffar et al. reported an increased inci￾dence of wound healing problems when the operative

procedures were performed within the first week

post-injury in an open setting [18]. Rammelt et al.

concluded that an operative intervention after 2

weeks also increases the complication rate, which

could be explained by increasing fracture consolida￾tion prior to surgery and a resulting need for higher

force with reduction [5]. In our proposed technique,

the surgery is intended to be performed within the

first 3 days after injury. Even in cases with edematous

tissue, our method did not lead to an increase in

wound healing disturbances. The earlier the surgery

was performed, the easier the mobilization of the

fragments became.

To overcome problems with wound complications,

wound infections, and skin necrosis specifically, many

minimally invasive methods to reduce and fix calcaneal

fractures have been proposed [14]. At the Traumacenter

Linz, this rate was 2.7% using the 2-point distraction

method. We believe this is not only a consequence of

the operative technique, but also a result of early surgical

intervention with hematoma evacuation, reduction, and

stabilization thereby leading to a decrease in internal

pressure.

In a meta-analysis, Fan et al. compared the clinical re￾sults after minimally invasive techniques to those after

ORIF. The study reported a lower soft tissue complica￾tion rate, and reduced duration of the operative proced￾ure itself. Also, functional results were almost equivalent

for the two groups [12].

The minimally invasive technique has become a stan￾dardized procedure at the Traumacenter Linz, and about

86% of all operatively treated fractures have been utilized

in the 2-point distractor technique.

Comparisons between the different methods of minim￾ally invasive techniques and ORIF methods are difficult

due to a lack of standardized measures, different tech￾niques, and a low number of patients [11, 14, 19, 20].

Wallin et al. published a systematic review on the clin￾ical results after minimally invasive techniques used to

treat calcaneal fractures. The functional results after San￾ders type II-IV compared with ORIF were promising, al￾though most of the studies had low levels of evidence. Soft

tissue complications and duration of the procedure were

lower in the minimally invasive group. They did not dis￾cuss whether minimally invasive techniques or ORIF led

to better anatomic reductions and functional results [14].

In a randomized controlled study, Kumar et al. found

a lower rate of wound healing problems, and better

functional outcomes in the minimally invasive group

compared with those after ORIF. The authors postu￾lated, that better functional outcomes can be explained

by a lower wound complication rate and a better ana￾tomical reconstruction [21]. In terms of anatomic recon￾struction, ORIF is still considered the goldstandard for

intra-articular fractures [1, 2, 8, 12].

In 2007, Schepers et al. presented their results on min￾imally invasive methods with a follow-up of 3 years.

Functional results after minimally invasive techniques

were lower compared to those reported after ORIF. The

infection and wound complication rates were similar to

Table 2 Annual distribution of the operative calcaneus fractures methods at the Traumacenter Linz from 2007 to 2015. Almost the

entire patient collective was treated by the minimally invasive technique with the 2-point distractor (85.8% versus 10.8%), which

represents a large study collective and indicates the effectiveness of this technique

those of ORIF. Subtalar joint motion could be restored

to nearly 70% compared to the uninjured side. The sec￾ondary arthrodesis rate was higher than in Buckley’s

study from 2002 [22, 23].

The most crucial factor for gaining a satisfactory re￾sult, according to Veltman, is the absence of complica￾tions [1]. Also, other authors concluded that the best

results were achieved when both, the operative proced￾ure, and aftercare were complication-free [2, 3]. Patients

with comorbidities such as vascular diseases, diabetes,

and nicotine abuse are more prone to these peri￾operative complications [2]. Also, patients over the

age of 60 years are more likely to be affected by post￾operative complications and subtalar arthritis, al￾though this may be linked to the higher rate of

comorbidities in elderly [2].

The published rate of arthrodesis is between 0 and

15% after minimally invasive surgery, 0–12% after ORIF,

and 3.8–17% after conservative means [22–31]. The sub￾talar arthrodesis rate of 0% described by Park et al. was

based on a relatively low number of patients and only 1

year follow-up [28]. In extremely complex intra-articular

fractures, a primary subtalar arthrodesis is deemed the

method of choice to achieve satisfactory results in the

given situation [2].

The secondary subtalar osteoarthritis rate requiring

arthrodesis after minimally invasive techniques was

4.7%. Between 2007 and 2015, this arthrodesis rate was

almost constant. No primary subtalar arthrodesis was

performed in our group of patients. The secondary arth￾rodesis rate of 4.7% after operative intervention in our

study is comparable to the current body of literature. In

a study published by Buckley et al., 37 of 218 (16.9%) pa￾tients required an arthrodesis, and 7 of 206 operatively

treated patients (3.4%) required a secondary operative

intervention [22]. More prospective randomized studies

with longer follow-up periods are required to compare

the results of minimally invasive techniques with ORIF

and conservative treatment.

After conservatively treated calcaneal fractures, a 6-

fold higher likelihood of arthrodesis has been published

compared to primarily surgically treated patients. Fur￾thermore, patients with Sanders Type IV, and patients

with a Boehler angle of 0 degrees had a notably in￾creased risk of secondary subtalar arthrodesis [32]. In

general, operative reconstruction of calcaneal fractures

provides a better tissue situation in cases which require

a secondary subtalar arthrodesis thereby also leading to

better long-term results [8].

Previous literature reported, that functional results

after minimally invasive treatment are equivalent to

those of ORIF [33, 34]. Based on these functional results,

together with lower complication rates, two recent stud￾ies have argued that minimally invasive techniques are

considered superior to open techniques in the treatment

of intra-articular fractures [12, 14].

Limitations

This study has certain limitations and weaknesses that

must be considered.

First and foremost, no clinical evaluations or functional

scores were assessed in the study cohort. This conse￾quently limits comparability among patient groups. There￾fore, this study was entirely focused on the rate of wound

complications, the need for secondary arthrodesis, and

relevant characteristics such as demographic data.

Future comparative studies are needed to verify the safety

of operative procedures for calcaneus fractures. Whether

this new technique will result in satisfactory long-term out￾comes, or can prevent post-traumatic osteoarthritis should

be determined in future prospective studies.

Conclusions

We believe that minimally invasive procedures for the

treatment of intra-articular calcaneus fractures can pro￾vide several benefits. These techniques lead to satisfac￾tory results when the whole process from clinical and

radiological examination, to indication, positioning of

the patient, intra-operative X-ray views, reduction tech￾niques, stabilization methods, and aftercare treatments

are performed in a standardized fashion. The main ad￾vantage of our proposed technique is the low rate of

wound complications compared to ORIF.

Background: Fractures of the calcaneus are severe injuries of the hindfoot, mostly

resulting from high-energy axial loads, which still present enormous challenges to modern

trauma surgery. Possible variables influencing the outcome are the type of fracture, age,

and quality of fracture reduction. These might also be factors affecting the self-reported

patient outcome, but large studies are still lacking. Therefore, the aim of this study was

to analyze the patient-reported outcome of calcaneal fractures following operative and

conservative treatment.

Methods: All patients suffering from calcaneal fractures between 2002 and 2015 were

enrolled in this retrospective analysis. The calcaneal fractures were classified according

to Sanders and the AO classification system. For further analysis, two groups were

formed: group I involved complex intra-articular fractures defined by the involvement

of the posterior calcaneal facet, while group II consisted of extra-articular and process

calcaneal fractures. Data were collected via the patient registry, radiographs, and a

standardized questionnaire (Foot and Ankle Outcome Score, FAOS). For outcome

analysis, non-parametric Mann–Whitney U-test was performed, and Spearman’s rank

correlation coefficient was calculated.

Results: In total, the functional outcome of 79 patients with calcaneal fractures was

analyzed. In group 1 (n = 43), the mean FAOS score was 65.5 ± 18.9. The surgically

treated patients with a Sanders type II calcaneal fracture had a mean FAOS score of 72.9

± 17.2, type III fractures had 65.6 ± 20.8, and type IV had 61.1 ± 19 (p = 0.15). The

reoperation rate was 22%, most frequently caused by wound complications (10%). The

mean follow-up time was 64.5 ± 44 months. The mean FAOS score of group 2 (n = 36)

was 75.2 ± 18.4, and 83% of the patients (=30) were managed conservatively. Only one

out of six operatively managed patients had a reoperation due to regular implant removal.

The mean follow-up time was 31 ± 25.9 months.

Conclusion: Intra-articular calcaneal fractures are severe injuries of the hindfoot leading

to a fair to poor functional outcome in the majority of the patients. Complications

INTRODUCTION

Fractures of the calcaneus are severe injuries presenting an

enormous challenge to modern trauma surgery care. Although

the calcaneus is involved in about 60% of all fractures of the lower

extremity, it remains to be of rare incidence accounting for about

2% of all skeletal fractures (1). Up to 75% of all calcaneal fractures

are severe intra-articular fractures, involving the subtalar joint

(2). Most calcaneal fractures occur in young male patients

around the age of 40 (3). Falls from height and motor vehicle

accidents are described as typical injury mechanisms in the

current literature (4, 5).

The computed tomography (CT)-based Sanders classification

system helps to precisely analyze and describe calcaneal fractures,

resulting in an adapted treatment plan depending on the severity

of the fracture (2, 6).

Nowadays, due to the development of new surgical techniques

and implants, displaced intra-articular fractures are more

frequently treated surgically (3). However, in the current

literature, there is still a lack of broad studies proving that

operative treatment is superior to non-operative treatment in

these cases (7). Important factors to consider in decision-making

regarding the best treatment are age, patient’s comorbidities,

functional demand, and compliance as well as the extent

of soft tissue injury and fracture characteristics (8). For

a satisfying outcome, it is essential to achieve adequate

fracture reduction along with restoring the anatomical joint

congruency (8).

Two reviews including operatively and non-operatively

managed calcaneal fractures state a fair long-term outcome (3, 7).

The adverse outcome is attributed to postoperative complications

and the high probability for late subtalar arthritis (3, 9, 10).

Calcaneal fractures not involving the subtalar joint are often

managed conservatively, and only vertical fractures of the

tuberosity, displaced medial process, and large anterior process

fractures are treated surgically (11). In contrast to complex intra￾articular calcaneal fractures, the overall outcome of operative

or non-operative managed process fractures of the calcaneus is

satisfactory (11–13).

Calcaneal fractures are rare skeletal injuries, often

leading to permanent pain and limitations, especially with

increasing fractures severity. There are important patient￾and injury-specific factors that determine the radiological

and functional outcome. These might also influence the self￾reported patient outcome, but large studies are still missing.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze the patient￾reported outcome of calcaneal fractures following operative and

conservative treatment.

METHODS

General Data

After ethical board approval (no: 409/15 S, Technical University

of Munich), the retrospective cohort study was conducted

between 2002 and 2015 in a level I trauma center. All patients

presenting with calcaneal fracture at the department of trauma

and orthopedic surgery were reviewed for enrollment. Inclusion

criteria: patients of 18 years and older who were capable of giving

informed consent and had suffered a calcaneal fracture Sanders

type I–IV or AO-83A-C as well as fractures of the anterior process

of the calcaneus or of the sustentaculum tali. The outcome of

conservatively and operatively managed patients was analyzed.

Patients with a fracture due to malignancy, an active malignancy,

substance abuse, presenting for revision surgery after external

operation, and with legal guardian were excluded.

Surgical Technique and Rehabilitation

A board-certified trauma surgeon specialized in lower extremity

surgery evaluated indications for surgery. Patients with a

displaced intraarticular calcaneal fracture (Sanders type II-IV)

were indicated for operative treatment. Only in cases where

operative treatment was unfeasible due to multiple comorbidities

or limited function (e.g., wheelchair, bedridden), intraarticular

fractures were managed conservatively. Operative treatment

involved open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) with

screw-, plate- or K-wire osteosynthesis. Surgery was performed

after soft tissue consolidation. In intra-articular fractures the

patient was placed in a lateral position, prophylactic cefuroxime

1.5 g was administered and a thigh tourniquet applied and

inflated, if necessary. Usually, preliminary fixation was achieved

via an extended lateral approach with the help of K-wires

and definitely secured with a locking compression plate. Only

in individual cases a minimal invasive approach for screw

osteosyntheses was performed.

Following open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF), the

patients had to partially weight bear for 6 weeks with a walking

boot. Patients with conservative treatment had to partially

weight bear for 6 to 8 weeks with a walking boot and undergo

regular radiographic evaluations. After 6 to 8 weeks and proper

radiographic follow-ups, full weight bearing without the walking

boot was allowed.

Radiological Analysis

Calcaneal fractures were classified based on CT images using the

Sanders as well as the AO classification system. According to the

fracture classification, two groups were formed: group 1 involved

complex intra-articular fractures defined by the involvement

of the posterior calcaneal facet, and group 2 consisted of

extra-articular and process calcaneal fractures including type

A fractures according to the AO classification, fractures of the

anterior process of the calcaneus, or of the sustentaculum tali.

The quality of surgery was evaluated by the postoperatively

restored Bohler’s angle. Studies showed that restoration of

Bohler’s angle can be crucial to obtain satisfactory results in

displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures (14, 15).

Only patients with a minimum radiological follow-up time of

3 months were included for further analysis. Radiographs and,

if available, CT were systematically analyzed to determine the

fracture type using the Sanders as well as the AO classification.

In all patients, the Bohler’s (standard: 25–40◦

) and the Gissane

(standard: 120–140◦

) angles were measured at the time of

fracture (1). In the surgically treated patients, these angles

were also determined after surgery (see Figure 1). The absolute

difference between pre- and postoperative angles was calculated.

Functional Outcome

For the evaluation of the functional outcome following calcaneal

fractures, the Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS) was

used. The FAOS is a self-administered patient-relevant outcome

questionnaire consisting of 42 items (range: 0–100). The German

version of the FAOS is a valid and reliable instrument for

foot and ankle patients (16). The FAOS results were graded

as “excellent” (100–90), “good” (89–80), “fair” (79–70), and

“poor” (<70) as adapted from the evaluation of Thordarson and

Krieger (17). After hospital treatment and standard postoperative

visits, patients were invited by letter to complete the FAOS.

The minimum follow-up for the patient-reported outcome was

12 months.

While general data such as age, gender, affected side, accident

type, hospital admission rate, and date of latest follow-up were

collected in both groups, additional information on American

Society for Anaesthesiologists (ASA) score, time between fracture

and surgery, implants, and reoperation rate were only collected in

the surgically treated group.

Statistics

Data was presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). RStudio

[RStudio Team (2020). RStudio: Integrated Development

Environment for R. RStudio, PBC, Boston, MA URL http://www.

rstudio.com/] was used for data processing.

The non-parametric Mann–Whitney U-test was used to

assess significant differences between two groups, assuming no

normally distributed data. To assess the correlation between two

variables, Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient was calculated.

We performed a multiple linear regression model when two

or more independent variables influenced the outcome. The

results of the inferential analysis are presented as 95% confidence

intervals. P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS

Between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2015, 108 patients

were treated at the department of trauma and orthopedic surgery

for a calcaneal fracture. In total, 79 patients (73%) were available

for further data analysis (Figure 2). The mean age was 54 ± 17

years, including 24 female and 55 male patients. In 40 patients

(51%), the right side was injured, whereas 39 (49%) patients

fractured their left calcaneus.

Complex Intra-Articular Fractures

General Data

In group 1, 43 patients were enrolled, with a mean age of 48

± 17 years, including eight female (19%) and 35 male (81%)

patients (see Table 1). In 22 patients (51%), the right side was

injured, whereas 21 (49%) patients fractured their left calcaneus.

The injury mechanism was in 34 cases a fall from height (>1 m),

in five cases traffic accidents, in two cases contusions of the foot,

and in two cases no further information on injury mechanism

was available. The mean ASA score of the operated patients was

1.6 ± 0.6. The mean follow-up time was 67 ± 45 months.

Radiological Analysis

Regarding the Sanders classification, 18 patients had a Sanders

type II, 16 a Sanders type III, and nine a type IV fracture. A total

of 37 patients (86%) were treated operatively after a mean of 6 ±

4.3 days. In the conservatively treated group, four patients had a

Sanders type II and two a Sanders type III fracture.

The mean preoperative Bohler’s angle accounted for 19 ±

8.9◦

(95% CI, 17.1–22.4), and the Gissane angle was 112 ±

12.8◦

(95% CI, 110.3–114.2). Postoperatively, the mean Bohler’s

angle was 29 ± 8.5◦

(95% CI, 27.2–32.2), and the Gissane angle

accounted for 117 ± 10.8◦

(95% CI, 115.5–119). Due to surgery,

the Bohler’s angle improved by 11 ± 7.9◦

(95% CI, 9.1–14.6) and

the Gissane angle by 13 ± 10.5◦

(95% CI, 10.4–16.5). The extent

of improvement of Bohler’s angle corrected for age and type of

fracture (Sanders classification) did not significantly influence the

FAOS score (p = 0.57). Patients with a preoperative Bohler’s angle

<15◦ demonstrated no adverse outcome (p = 0.72).

Functional Outcome

The overall mean FAOS score was 67 ± 18.3 (95% CI, 61–72),

with five “excellent” (12%), eight “good” (19%), four “fair” (9%),

and 26 “poor” (60%) results. The surgically treated patients with

a Sanders type II calcaneal fracture had a mean FAOS score of 73

± 17.2 (95% CI, 64–80.9), type III fractures presented a FAOS

score of 66 ± 20.8 (95% CI, 53.9–77.4), and type IV fractures

showed a score of 61 ± 19 (95% CI, 49.9–72.4) (Figure 3).

Regarding the FAOS score, no significant differences were found

between surgically treated Sanders-type fractures (p = 0.23).

The age of the patient adjusted to the type of fracture (Sanders

classification) did not significantly influence the FAOS score (p =

0.39). There was also no difference between operatively (n = 14)

and conservatively (n = 4) treated Sanders type II fractures (p =

0.36). Patients requiring revision surgery had a mean FAOS of 62

± 19.45 (95% CI, 49.4–74.8).

Reoperation, Implants, and Hardware Removal

Eight of 37 patients (22%) needed revision surgery, whereas five

cases had complications with wound healing (14%) and one

patient suffered from implant failure (3%). One patient developed

a tarsal tunnel syndrome (3%) and another one had arthritis of

the subtalar joint with following subtalar arthrodesis 4 years after

the initial trauma. The wound healing complications occurred

in four Sanders type III and another one in a type II fracture.

The subtalar arthrodesis was the consequence of Sanders type

IV fracture. Patients requiring revision surgery did not have a

significantly lower FAOS score (p = 0.52).

In 73% (n = 27) of the cases, locking compression plate

osteosynthesis was performed, and 8% (n = 3) received non￾locking plate osteosynthesis, whereas in 16% (n = 6) of

the cases screws were used (Table 2). The extended lateral

approach was used for the locking compression and non-locking

plates (n = 30); screws were inserted through a stab incision

under radiological guidance (n = 3) and additionally under

arthroscopic visualization of the subtalar joint (n = 3). The

percutaneous locking plate was implanted via a sinus tarsi

approach. After bone consolidation, the implant was removed in

54% (n = 20) of the patients after a mean of 14 ± 3.4 months.

Extra-Articular and Process Fractures

General Data

In total, 36 patients matched our inclusion criteria for this cohort.

The mean age was 44 ± 17 years, including 16 female (44%)

and 20 male (56%) patients (Table 1). In 18 patients (50%), the

right side was injured, whereas the other 18 (50%) fractured their

left calcaneus. Six patients (17%) were treated operatively after

a mean of 6 ± 4.9 days. Three patients had a type A2 fracture,

and another three patients showed a fracture of the anterior

process of the calcaneus. The remaining 30 patients were treated

conservatively. The mean ASA score of the operated patients was

1.5 ± 0.5. The follow-up time was 31 ± 25.9 months.

Radiological Analysis

Regarding the classification, seven patients had a type A fracture

according to the AO classification, while 26 had a fracture of the

anterior process of the calcaneus and three other fractures (two

stress fractures, only visible in MRI scans and one fracture of the

sustentaculum tali).

The mean Bohler’s angle was 33 ± 5.9◦

(95% CI, 30.8–

34.7), and the Gissane angle accounted for 118 ± 10.3◦

(95%

CI, 114.7–121.5).

Functional Outcome

The mean FAOS score was 75 ± 18.4 (95% CI, 69.2–81.2),

with nine “excellent” (25%), nine “good” (25%), seven “fair”

(19%), and 11 “poor” (31%) results. The type A fractures had a

mean FAOS score of 86 ± 7 (95% CI, 80.6–90.9). There was no

difference between operatively and conservatively treated type

A fractures (p = 0.57). The mean FAOS score of patients with

fractures of the anterior process of the calcaneus was 73 ± 19.3

(95% CI, 65.8–80.6). The surgically treated patients (n = 3) had

a FAOS score of 50 ± 15.5 (95% CI, 26.2–74.5), and the non￾operatively treated patients (n = 23) had a score of 76 ± 17.6

(95% CI, 68.9–83.5). We found no correlation between age and

FAOS score in the group of type A fractures and fractures of the

anterior process of the calcaneus (pA = 0.45; pP = 0.50).

Reoperation, Implants, and Hardware Removal

Patients with an anterior process fracture and operative

treatment, received two times a K-wire osteosynthesis and once

screw osteosynthesis was performed. Only one patient had a

planned K-wire removal 3 months postoperatively. In the case of

type A fractures, screw osteosynthesis was performed two times

and once in combination with plate osteosynthesis.

DISCUSSION

Overall, the functional outcome of 79 patients including

43 complex intra-articular and 36 extra-articular or process

fractures of the calcaneus treated between 2002 and 2015 was

assessed. The majority of patients with intra-articular calcaneal

fractures only reached “poor” results, and the functional outcome

was not significantly influenced by age or Sanders classification.

Sanders type IV fractures tended to have the lowest FAOS score,

but the difference between Sanders type fracture did not reach a

level of significance. Wound infections were the most common

cause for reoperation in this subgroup. Patients with an extra￾articular or process fracture of the calcaneus were mostly treated

non-operatively and stated a better self-reported outcome.

Patients with an extra-articular or process fracture of

the calcaneus reached a mean FAOS of 75. The studies in

the literature involving extra-articular or process fracture of

the calcaneus were solely retrospectively performed with a

small number of patients. Consequently, there is still missing

evidence concerning the optimal therapy regimen in these cases.

The fractures are mainly treated conservatively, and only in

displaced fractures is operation indicated (8, 12, 18, 19). Overall,

studies reported a satisfactory outcome after conservatively or

operatively treated extra-articular calcaneal fractures (11, 12, 20),

but inadequately treated tuberosity avulsion fractures can lead to

limitations involving the Achilles tendon and, in case of anterior

process fractures, to painful non-unions (11).

The mean age of included patients suffering from intra￾articular calcaneal fractures was 48 years, with a preponderance

of male patients. In the majority of the cases, a fall from height

was the injury mechanism. In comparison to other studies in

the literature, the demographic data shows a typical age and

gender distribution for calcaneal fractures since these fractures

are often seen in young males with high-energy trauma (5, 21).

The majority of these patients were treated operatively after a

mean time of 6.5 days. This is in line with the trend toward

a surgical approach over the last two decades (8). Operative

treatment can be advantageous depending on patient factors,

the soft tissue conditions, and fracture characteristics (3). Since

soft tissue management is essential in calcaneal fractures, the

swelling should be minimized before surgery is performed (2).

This usually occurs within 10 days according to current literature

(6). A delay to surgery over 14 days is associated with a greater

risk of complications (22–24).

Other studies analyzing the treatment of displaced intra￾articular calcaneal fractures report functional outcome scores

ranging from 68 to 84 points regarding the American

Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) hindfoot score

(9, 14, 24, 25). The AOFAS score consists of physical examination,

reported function, self-reported pain items. Its validity and

reliability have been criticized in the literature before (26, 27).

The slightly inferior score, on average, might be due to the study

design using a solely patient-reported outcome measurement

tool. In contrast to the AOFAS, the FAOS includes items for

activities of daily living, sport and recreational activities, and

foot- and ankle-related quality-of-life items. Due to the severity

of the injury, low self-reported ratings in these categories are

plausible, leading to an overall lower score. In general, there is

a slight trend toward patient-reported outcome measurement

tools since they provide benefits regarding safety, effectiveness,

and experience (28). Patients become involved by directly

assessing their symptoms, disability, and quality of life, thereby

avoiding observer bias. To date, the presented work reports

about the largest patient population suffering from calcaneal

fractures using a self-reported patient outcome measurement

questionnaire to assess and analyze functional outcome.

The analysis show no relation between age, Sanders

classification, and functional outcome score in the patient

population. These findings are in accordance with a recently

published study of Evers et al., who found no association between

age and functional outcome in intra-articular surgically treated

calcaneal fractures (24). In contrast to these findings, Buckley

et al. showed, in a subgroup analysis of a randomized control

trial, that patients younger than 29 years scored significantly

higher on the scoring scales after surgery of a displaced intra￾articular calcaneal fracture compared to conservative treatment

(29), but two other studies reporting on 44 and 33 patients

found satisfactory outcome results of patients older than 65

years (30, 31). The mentioned controversial studies show that

the functional outcome cannot be traced down to only the

age of the patients. In fact, multiple other factors, such as co￾morbidities, have to be considered. Peripheral vascular disease,

poorly controlled diabetes, and smoking habits are independent

risk factors for an adverse outcome (10, 32).

There was no significant difference between Sanders fracture

types treated surgically regarding the functional outcome.

Sanders et al. stated in a study in 2014 that the Sanders

classification system still remains prognostic and that severe

fractures were more likely to develop an adverse outcome (6),

which is in line with the results of the FAOS among the different

Sanders type fractures with a trend to a worse outcome with

increasing severity without reaching a level of significance. Other

studies also reported that Sanders type II fractures lead to better

results than type III and IV calcaneal fractures (9, 33), but there

are also studies that criticize the classification system due to a low

intra- and interobserver reliability (34, 35).

The presented data did not show a significant difference

between operatively and non-operatively treated Sanders type II

fractures. This is in some way not surprising considering that

long-term results of surgically treated calcaneus fractures only

show fair results and a review published by Luo et al. came to

the conclusion that there is no certainty about the superiority

of the operative treatment for displaced intra-articular calcaneal

fractures (7, 36). But there are two important factors to consider

in this context: first, the retrospective study design and the small

number of Sanders type II fractures which were managed non￾operatively. Second, the long-term studies and reviews included

analysis from the 1990s; since then, new and allegedly better

techniques (e.g., minimally invasive) for open reduction and

internal fixation were developed.

In the patient cohort, both the Bohler’s and the Gissane’s

angle improved postoperatively; however, the relation between

the improvement of Bohler’s angle, Sanders classification, and

the functional outcome was not significantly different. Several

studies support this observation, showing no correlation between

Bohler’s angle and the final functional outcome (37–39). The

only correlation between Bohler’s angle and outcome might be

too simple since different factors influence the outcome. The

congruity of the articular surface of the posterior facet, only

visualized on CT scans, especially seems to significantly influence

the final outcome (40, 41).

The 22% re-operation rate, which was mostly caused

by wound infections, is in line with the current literature

considering that mainly an extended lateral approach was

used in the presented study (3, 37). New minimally invasive

techniques, e.g., the sinus tarsi approach, can reduce wound

infections compared to an extended lateral approach in displaced

intra-articular fractures, whilst the functional outcome showed

comparable results (42). A review analyzing eight case series

of displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures treated with the

sinus tarsi approach came to the conclusion that well-designed

randomized trials are needed to clearly prove superiority (43).

Studies are awaited to demonstrate definite indications for a

limited lateral approach in displaced intra-articular calcaneal

fractures, leading to a satisfactory outcome.

The study results clearly show that the treatment of intra￾articular calcaneal fractures calls for improvements in patient

care since self-reported outcome is often poor. In intra-articular

calcaneal fractures, operative treatment was mainly performed

via an extended lateral approach and revision surgery mostly

caused by wound complications. In clinical practice, operative

treatment needs to focus on a surgical approach with minimal

soft tissue damage and optimal reduction with the help of

adjacent modern tools to fully restore the congruity of the

articular surface of the posterior facet.

The results of the presented study may be influenced by several

potential limitations. Due to its retrospective design, there was

no randomization of the patients, and no a priori sample size

calculation was performed. The solely patient-reported outcome

might distort the final results since the FAOS score includes more

categories representing activity and participation. Furthermore,

long-term clinical and radiological results were not part of the

study, and radiographs were taken for clinical follow-up and

not for research purposes in a strictly standardized manner. The

reported posttraumatic arthritis rate needs to be interpreted with

caution. The surgical procedures evaluated in this study were

performed between 2002 and 2015, and especially in regard to

the first years, the type of implants and surgical management

evolved over the years. However, to the authors’ knowledge,

the study differs from the previously published studies in terms

of providing current evidence regarding the patient-reported

outcome following the operative and conservative treatment of

fractures to the calcaneus.

CONCLUSIONS

Intra-articular calcaneal fractures are severe injuries of the

hindfoot, leading to a fair to poor functional outcome in the

majority of the patients. Complications regarding wound healing

are the most common causes for revisional surgery. Extra￾articular calcaneal fractures are a heterogenous entity commonly

managed non-operatively. Overall, they show a better functional

outcome in comparison to intra-articular calcaneal fractures.

Abstract

This comprehensive review delves into the multifaceted landscape of calcaneal fractures, thoroughly

examining their aetiology, clinical presentation, and diverse management strategies. Encompassing surgical

and non-surgical approaches, the review scrutinises critical aspects such as patient compliance,

rehabilitation protocols, and long-term follow-up considerations. Surgical modalities, propelled by recent

innovations like minimally invasive techniques and advanced fixation materials, are juxtaposed with non￾surgical interventions, emphasising the pivotal role of patient education and adherence to optimise

outcomes. The synthesis of critical findings underscores the need for individualised care and

multidisciplinary collaboration in clinical practice. Moreover, the review outlines recommendations for

healthcare practitioners and identifies promising areas for future research, including biomechanical studies

and telerehabilitation. This comprehensive exploration aims to contribute to the ongoing evolution of

calcaneal fracture management, ultimately enhancing patient care and outcomes in this complex

orthopaedic realm.

Introduction And Background

Calcaneal fractures involving the heel bone represent a complex orthopaedic challenge due to the intricate

anatomy and the pivotal role of the calcaneus in weight-bearing. Typically resulting from high-energy

trauma such as falls from height or motor vehicle accidents, these fractures can significantly impact a

patient's quality of life. The calcaneus is a critical component of the foot's arch and is crucial in maintaining

stability during ambulation. Understanding the nuances of calcaneal fractures is paramount for clinicians

involved in their management [1].

The annual incidence of calcaneal fractures is approximately 11.5 per 100,000 individuals, with a

significantly higher occurrence in males (16.5 per 100,000) than females. Falls from a height are the most

common cause of calcaneal fractures, accounting for approximately 47.5% of cases. Calcaneal fractures are

relatively uncommon, comprising 1 to 2% of all fractures [2]. Effective management of calcaneal fractures is

imperative to mitigate complications and ensure optimal functional outcomes. The intricate interplay of

subtalar joint function, soft tissue integrity, and the complex anatomy of the calcaneus necessitates a

comprehensive approach. Neglected or improperly managed calcaneal fractures can lead to persistent pain,

altered gait, and long-term disability. Hence, a nuanced understanding of surgical and non-surgical

interventions is crucial for healthcare professionals treating calcaneal fractures [2].

The purpose of this review is to provide a thorough examination of the various modalities available for the

management of calcaneal fractures. By synthesising current literature, we aim to offer insights into clinical

presentation, diagnostic considerations, and treatment options, including surgical and non-surgical

approaches. This comprehensive exploration seeks to equip healthcare practitioners with a nuanced

understanding of the complexities associated with calcaneal fractures, facilitating informed decision￾making in pursuing optimal patient outcomes. Through this review, we aspire to contribute to the evolving

landscape of calcaneal fracture management, fostering a holistic and evidence-based approach in clinical

practice.

of injury for calcaneal fractures. The impact force generated upon landing can exert substantial pressure on

the calcaneus, resulting in fractures. Individuals involved in occupations or activities that require working at

heights face an increased risk, making fall prevention measures and safety protocols crucial in mitigating

such incidents [3].

Motor vehicle accidents: In the context of motor vehicle accidents, collisions can have severe implications

for the calcaneus, especially when the foot experiences direct impact or crushing forces. High-speed

accidents amplify the trauma, leading to fractures. Understanding the dynamics of these accidents and

implementing preventive measures, such as proper vehicle safety features and awareness campaigns,

becomes essential in reducing the incidence of calcaneal fractures in these scenarios [4].

Sports-related injuries: Certain sports, particularly those involving contact or rapid changes in direction,

pose a heightened risk of traumatic foot injuries, including calcaneal fractures. Athletes engaged in activities

such as football, basketball, or gymnastics may be susceptible. Injury prevention strategies, such as proper

training techniques, equipment, and awareness programs, are integral in minimising the risk of sports￾related calcaneal fractures [5].

Crush injuries: Occupational settings involving heavy machinery or equipment present a specific risk for

crush injuries to the calcaneus. Accidents where the foot is subjected to crushing forces can result in

fractures. Occupational safety measures, including training, proper use of protective gear, and machinery

safety protocols, are imperative to reduce the occurrence of crush injuries and subsequent calcaneal

fractures in workplaces with these hazards [6].

Mechanism of Calcaneal Fracture

The mechanism of injury typically involves a high-energy axial load applied to the heel, which drives the

talus downward onto the calcaneus. A combination of shear and compression forces produces two

characteristic primary fracture lines. Shearing forces produce a fracture dividing the calcaneus into medial

and lateral portions. Compression forces divide the calcaneus into anterior and posterior portions. This

fracture line can extend medially to involve the middle facet. Loss of calcaneal height and length are readily

explained by this mechanism [3].

Risk Factors

Osteoporosis: Osteoporosis, characterised by reduced bone density and compromised bone strength,

significantly heightens the vulnerability to fractures, particularly in the elderly. As a weight-bearing bone,

the calcaneus becomes particularly susceptible to fractures due to osteoporosis. Preventive measures,

including bone density assessments, dietary interventions, and appropriate medical management, are crucial

in mitigating the risk of calcaneal fractures in individuals with osteoporosis [7].

Occupational hazards: Professions that involve extended periods of standing, heavy lifting, or exposure to

potential foot injuries pose a heightened risk of calcaneal fractures. Workers in construction, manufacturing,

or other physically demanding occupations may be particularly vulnerable. Implementing workplace safety

measures, providing proper footwear, and educating employees on injury prevention contribute to reducing

the occupational hazards associated with calcaneal fractures [8].

Age and gender: Younger individuals, especially males, face an elevated risk of calcaneal fractures due to

increased participation in activities with a higher potential for trauma. The propensity to engage in

physically demanding or high-impact activities increases the risk. Tailoring preventive strategies, such as

targeted educational campaigns and safety guidelines, to this demographic is essential in reducing the

incidence of calcaneal fractures in these populations [9].

Medical conditions: Certain conditions, such as peripheral or diabetic neuropathy, compromise foot

sensation, leading to an increased risk of falls and subsequent calcaneal fractures. Individuals with these

conditions may not perceive potential hazards or uneven surfaces, contributing to an elevated risk. Routine

foot examinations, sensory testing, and fall prevention strategies are paramount in managing the

heightened risk associated with specific medical conditions and reducing the incidence of calcaneal fractures

in affected individuals [10].

Types of Calcaneal Fractures

Intra-articular fractures: Intra-articular fractures involve the extension of the fracture into the subtalar joint,

significantly impacting joint congruity and function. These fractures often present complex challenges,

directly affecting the articulation between the calcaneus and surrounding bones. Management of intra￾articular fractures requires meticulous attention to anatomical alignment to preserve joint function and

surgical intervention may be indicated to achieve optimal outcomes [11].

2024 Chirayath et al. Cureus 16(2): e54786. DOI 10.7759/cureus.54786 2 of 14

Extra-articular fractures: Extra-articular fractures, in contrast, do not involve the subtalar joint and typically

affect the body or process of the calcaneus. While they may be less complex than intra-articular fractures,

they require careful evaluation and management. The absence of joint involvement may influence treatment

choice, with non-surgical approaches being more feasible in some instances [12].

Closed fractures: Closed fractures are characterised by an intact skin surface, reducing the risk of infection

compared to open fractures. Despite the lower risk of infection, careful management is essential, involving

accurate diagnosis through imaging, immobilisation, and adherence to rehabilitation protocols. The

potential for complications, such as delayed union or nonunion, necessitates close monitoring and

appropriate intervention to facilitate optimal healing [12].

Open fractures: Open fractures, marked by a break in the skin, pose a heightened risk of infection and often

demand urgent attention. The exposure of the fracture site to external contaminants necessitates prompt

wound management, debridement, and administration of antibiotics. Surgical intervention is often

indicated to address both the fracture and the associated soft tissue injuries. Open fractures require a

comprehensive and coordinated approach to minimise the risk of complications and optimise the chances of

successful healing [12].

Clinical presentation

Signs and Symptoms

Pain: Pain is a hallmark symptom of calcaneal fractures, characterised by acute and localised discomfort at

the heel. This pain is often intensified during weight-bearing activities, reflecting the stress placed on the

fractured calcaneus. The severity of pain can vary depending on the extent and type of fracture, influencing

both the diagnosis and subsequent management strategies aimed at pain relief and functional recovery [13].

Swelling: Edema, or swelling, is a common clinical manifestation observed around the heel and the lateral

aspect of the foot in cases of calcaneal fractures. The presence of swelling indicates soft tissue involvement

and is a critical clinical sign used in conjunction with other symptoms and diagnostic tools to assess the

extent of the injury. Effective management often includes interventions to address and reduce this swelling,

improving patient comfort and recovery [13].

Ecchymosis: Bruising, or ecchymosis, may develop in the presence of associated soft tissue injury

accompanying calcaneal fractures. The discolouration results from blood leakage into the surrounding

tissues, providing valuable visual cues for healthcare professionals during clinical assessment. The severity

and distribution of ecchymosis contribute to the overall understanding of the injury and guide appropriate

treatment strategies [13].

Deformity: In more severe calcaneal fractures, visible deformity or widening of the heel may be observed.

This deformity is indicative of significant displacement or disruption of the calcaneal anatomy. Recognising

and assessing deformities are crucial in diagnosing and classifying fractures and guiding treatment decisions

towards interventions that restore proper anatomical alignment [13].

Impaired function: Calcaneal fractures often lead to impaired function, with patients having trouble walking

and noticeable alterations in gait and weight-bearing. The extent of functional impairment varies depending

on the severity and type of fracture. Comprehensive rehabilitation strategies, including physiotherapy and

targeted exercises, are crucial components of the treatment plan to address impaired function and facilitate

a gradual return to normal activities [13].

Diagnostic Tools and Imaging Techniques

In addition to standard radiographs, which include anteroposterior (AP) and lateral views, diagnostic

imaging for calcaneal fractures should encompass assessment for specific radiological signs such as

Mondor's Sign, Bohler's Angle, and the Critical Angle of Gissane. These signs offer valuable insights into

fracture patterns and associated soft tissue injuries, aiding in accurate diagnosis and treatment planning [3].

X-ray imaging: X-ray imaging is a foundational diagnostic tool for evaluating calcaneal fractures. Alongside

standard radiographs, oblique views may enhance the visualisation of fracture patterns not clearly

discernible in standard projections. X-rays play a crucial role in guiding treatment decisions and

determining the appropriate management course by providing initial insights into the fracture extent and

configuration [3].

Computed tomography (CT) scans: CT scans provide a more detailed and three-dimensional assessment of

calcaneal fractures, facilitating thorough evaluation of intra-articular involvement, fracture displacement,

and comminution. CT imaging offers a comprehensive visualisation of the bony structures, aiding

orthopaedic surgeons in surgical planning and providing a more precise understanding of the fracture's

complexity [3].

2024 Chirayath et al. Cureus 16(2): e54786. DOI 10.7759/cureus.54786 3 of 14

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): MRI is indispensable for assessing soft tissue injuries associated with

calcaneal fractures, including ligamentous involvement and subtalar joint damage. By offering detailed

images of soft tissues, MRI complements information obtained from X-rays and CT scans, providing a

comprehensive understanding of the injury's extent, particularly beyond the bony structures [3].

Ultrasonography: Although less commonly utilised for calcaneal fractures, ultrasonography can effectively

assess soft tissue injuries and hematoma formation. This imaging modality utilises sound waves to generate

real-time images, providing dynamic visualisation of the soft tissues surrounding the calcaneus. While less

frequently employed than X-rays, CT scans, or MRI, ultrasonography may offer valuable insights into soft

tissue components of the injury in specific cases [3]. Additionally, the assessment of Mondor's Sign, Bohler's

Angle, and the Critical Angle of Gissane should be incorporated into the diagnostic protocol to ensure

comprehensive evaluation and accurate diagnosis of calcaneal fractures. Classification systems for calcaneal

fractures are described in Table 1 [14].

Non-surgical modalities

Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation (RICE)

Rest: Rest is the cornerstone of the initial management of calcaneal fractures, aiming to minimise weight￾bearing on the affected foot. By reducing mechanical stress on the fractured calcaneus, rest provides the

necessary conditions for the bone to heal. Immobilisation, often achieved through the use of crutches or a

brace, serves to prevent further trauma to the injured area. This critical phase of rest allows for the initial

stages of healing and sets the foundation for subsequent rehabilitation [1-2].

Ice: Cold therapy, in the form of ice application, is integral in managing pain and inflammation associated

with calcaneal fractures. Applying ice packs to the affected area in 20-minute intervals helps constrict blood

vessels, reducing blood flow to the injured site and alleviating pain. Cold therapy is particularly effective in

the early stages post-injury, contributing to the patient's overall comfort and aiding in controlling

inflammatory responses [2].

Compression: Compression controls swelling and supports the injured foot. Compression bandages or wraps

help minimise oedema by exerting pressure on the tissues, preventing excessive fluid accumulation. It is

essential, however, to apply compression carefully to avoid excessive pressure that may compromise blood

circulation. Properly applied compression contributes to the overall stability of the injured area and assists

in creating a conducive environment for healing [3].

Elevation: Elevating the foot above heart level, especially during rest periods, is a simple yet effective

measure to minimise swelling associated with calcaneal fractures. By facilitating fluid drainage and reducing

the pooling of blood and other fluids in the injured region, elevation complements the actions of rest, ice,

and compression. This elevation strategy is often recommended as part of the initial management protocol

and aids in creating an environment conducive to optimal healing [1].

2024 Chirayath et al. Cureus 16(2): e54786. DOI 10.7759/cureus.54786 4 of 14

Analgesic and Anti-Inflammatory Medications

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): NSAIDs represent a pharmacological approach to pain

management and inflammation reduction in the context of calcaneal fractures. Medications such as

ibuprofen or naproxen are often prescribed to alleviate pain by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins,

which contribute to pain and inflammation. While NSAIDs are effective, caution is advised due to potential

side effects such as gastrointestinal irritation, renal issues, and interactions with other medications.

Healthcare providers carefully consider the patient's medical history, existing conditions, and the potential

for adverse effects before recommending NSAIDs [15].

Pain management: Analgesics, including acetaminophen, are employed for pain control in individuals with

calcaneal fractures, particularly in cases where NSAIDs may be contraindicated or not well-tolerated.

Acetaminophen functions centrally to reduce pain perception and is often chosen when anti-inflammatory

effects are not the primary focus. As with any medication, appropriate dosage and adherence to

recommended guidelines are essential to mitigate the risk of adverse effects. Pain management strategies

are tailored to the individual patient, considering factors such as pain intensity, overall health, and potential

drug interactions [16].

Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation

Range of motion exercises: One key component of physiotherapy involves a range of motion exercises aimed

at enhancing flexibility without exerting undue pressure on the healing heel. These exercises include gentle

toe flexion and extension movements, fostering toe flexibility while mitigating strain on the injured area.

Additionally, controlled ankle circles are employed to maintain mobility in the ankle joint, contributing to

overall joint health during the recovery phase [17].

Strengthening exercises: Strengthening exercises are integral to the rehabilitation program, targeting the

gradual restoration of muscle strength. Calf raises are fundamental exercises involving the heel's incremental

elevation while standing, effectively engaging and strengthening the calf muscles. Seated toe-tapping

exercises provide a rhythmic and controlled method to enhance foot and ankle strength, improving overall

lower extremity function [18].

Weight-bearing progression: The progression of weight-bearing activities is carefully managed to prevent

muscle atrophy and facilitate optimal healing. Physiotherapists introduce partial weight-bearing activities

tailored to patients' tolerance to prevent disease-related complications. As healing advances, a progressive

weight-bearing approach is implemented, with the physiotherapist guiding the sequential increase in

weight-bearing activities. This stepwise progression aligns with the individual's healing trajectory, ensuring

a balance between promoting recovery and minimising the risk of complications [19].

Surgical modalities

Indications for Surgery

Joint involvement: Fractures with significant intra-articular displacement, especially those impacting joint

surfaces, may necessitate surgical intervention. Joint involvement poses a risk of altered joint congruity,

which, if not addressed, could lead to long-term arthritis and functional impairment. Surgery, in these cases,

aims to restore joint alignment and minimise the risk of degenerative changes, ultimately preserving joint

function and minimising post-traumatic complications [20].

Severe displacement: Calcaneal fractures demonstrating substantial displacement, particularly when

involving the subtalar joint, often require surgical reduction and fixation. The severity of displacement can

compromise anatomical alignment, affecting the foot biomechanics. Surgical interventions, such as open

reduction and internal fixation, are employed to realign the fractured fragments and stabilise the calcaneus.

This surgical approach optimises long-term outcomes by addressing the significant displacement observed

in severe fractures [11].

Open fractures: Surgical intervention is frequently indicated for open fractures, with a break in the skin.

Open fractures pose an increased risk of infection due to exposure of the fracture site to external

contaminants. Surgical procedures are performed to reduce the risk of infection, facilitate proper wound

management, and stabilise the fractured calcaneus. Swift intervention is crucial to minimise complications

associated with open fractures and promote optimal healing [21].

Intra-articular step-offs: The presence of step-offs or gaps in the articular surface, particularly those

affecting joint function and stability, may necessitate surgical correction. Intra-articular step-offs can

disrupt joint congruity, leading to impaired joint mechanics and potential post-traumatic arthritis. Surgical

techniques, including precision reduction and fixation, restore the articular surface and prevent long-term

joint dysfunction. Addressing intra-articular step-offs is paramount to achieving optimal functional

outcomes in calcaneal fractures [22].

2024 Chirayath et al. Cureus 16(2): e54786. DOI 10.7759/cureus.54786 5 of 14

Timing of Surgery

Early surgical intervention: Early surgical intervention may be deemed necessary in specific cases,

particularly those involving open fractures or instances with vascular compromise. Open fractures, where

the skin is disrupted, pose an increased risk of infection and require prompt attention to address bone and

soft tissue injuries. Additionally, cases with vascular compromise demand immediate surgical measures to

restore blood supply and prevent further complications. Early surgery in these situations aims to mitigate

the risks associated with open fractures and vascular compromise, facilitating optimal wound management

and reducing the likelihood of postoperative complications [23].

Delayed surgery: In contrast, there are situations where a delayed surgical approach is preferred. Delayed

surgery involves waiting until the initial soft tissue swelling and inflammation have subsided. This delay

allows for improved surgical site visualisation, facilitating more precise interventions and reducing the risk

of complications related to excessive soft tissue tension during surgery. Opting for delayed surgery can

contribute to better wound healing, decreased postoperative swelling, and reduced potential complications.

This approach is often considered when the immediate surgical risks associated with soft tissue compromise

are outweighed by the benefits of a delayed, more controlled intervention [24].

Surgical Approaches

Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF): ORIF is a critical surgical intervention for calcaneal fractures,

involving precise fracture reduction followed by internal stabilisation. Two primary approaches are

commonly employed in ORIF procedures [25]. The lateral extensile approach is a widely used method

featuring a lateral incision that provides direct access to the calcaneus. This approach allows for a

comprehensive view of the fracture site, facilitating meticulous reduction and stabilisation of the bone

fragments. The advantages of the lateral extensile approach lie in its exposure capabilities, enabling

surgeons to achieve accurate fixation and alignment during the surgical procedure [25]. In contrast, the

sinus tarsi approach is a more limited lateral approach designed to minimise soft tissue disruption, often

preferred for intra-articular fractures. By carefully navigating the sinus tarsi, surgeons can access and

manage fractures within the subtalar joint. This approach aims to preserve surrounding tissues, providing a

more conservative option while addressing fractures within the subtalar joint [25].

Percutaneous Fixation Techniques

Percutaneous fixation techniques offer minimally invasive alternatives for stabilising calcaneal fractures,

providing benefits such as reduced soft tissue trauma and expedited recovery. Two prevalent percutaneous

techniques include [26]. Percutaneous screw fixation involves the insertion of screws through small incisions

directly into the fractured segments of the calcaneus. This minimally invasive technique aims to achieve

stability and alignment without requiring extensive incisions. Percutaneous screw fixation is particularly

advantageous for fractures amenable to this approach, offering benefits such as decreased soft tissue trauma

and potentially faster postoperative recovery [27]. On the other hand, external fixation entails the

application of external frames to maintain alignment and stability in the fractured calcaneus. This technique

is often employed in complex fractures or situations where internal fixation is not optimal. The external

frame supports and allows controlled adjustments, contributing to overall stability. While involving the

placement of pins through the skin into the bone, external fixation proves advantageous in specific clinical

scenarios [28].

Complications Associated with Surgical Interventions

Infection: Surgical procedures, especially in the context of open fractures, carry an inherent risk of infection.

Open fractures involve a break in the skin, exposing the fracture site to external contaminants. Infections

can compromise the healing process and may necessitate additional interventions, such as debridement or

antibiotic therapy, to manage and mitigate the risk of systemic spread. Vigilant postoperative care and

monitoring are crucial to identify and address infections promptly [23].

Wound healing issues: Impaired wound healing or skin necrosis can be complications associated with

surgical intervention, particularly when extensive soft tissue dissection is required. Factors such as

compromised blood supply, pre-existing medical conditions, or wound site infection can contribute to

delayed wound healing. Close postoperative monitoring and wound care are essential to identify and address

issues promptly, minimising the risk of further complications [29].

Hardware-related complications: The use of hardware in surgical fixation, such as screws or plates, can lead

to complications such as loosening, migration, or irritation. Hardware-related issues may necessitate

revision surgeries to address instability or discomfort. Regular follow-up assessments, imaging studies, and

patient feedback are crucial in identifying and managing hardware-related complications to ensure the

stability and effectiveness of the fixation [30].

Post-traumatic arthritis: Despite surgical intervention, some patients may develop post-traumatic arthritis,

2024 Chirayath et al. Cureus 16(2): e54786. DOI 10.7759/cureus.54786 6 of 14

especially when there is significant joint involvement. Arthritic changes can occur over time, affecting joint

function and causing pain. This long-term complication may require ongoing management, including pain

control measures, lifestyle modifications, or, in severe cases, joint replacement surgery [31].

Neurovascular compromise: Nerve or vascular injuries may occur during surgery, leading to sensory or

circulatory deficits. Careful preoperative planning, intraoperative monitoring, and surgical precision are

essential to minimise the risk of neurovascular compromise. Postoperative assessments for signs of nerve

damage or vascular compromise are crucial, and prompt intervention may be necessary to address these

complications and optimise patient outcomes [32].

Comparative analysis

Pros and Cons of Surgical vs. Non-surgical Approaches

The decision to pursue surgical or non-surgical treatment for calcaneal fractures should be made on a case￾by-case basis, considering the fracture's specific characteristics and the patient's circumstances. Some

studies suggest that surgical treatment may lead to better recovery of the Bohler's Angle and more stable

calcaneal height, while others report conflicting results [33-35]. It is essential to weigh the potential

benefits of surgical intervention against the risks, including infection, nerve damage, and prolonged

recovery time [33,35]. Non-surgical approaches may be associated with a lower risk of complications. Still,

they may not always result in optimal anatomical and functional outcomes, especially in severe

displacement or intra-articular involvement [34]. The functional outcomes of surgical versus non-surgical

treatment for calcaneal fractures remain a topic of debate. While some studies suggest that surgical

treatment may lead to better anatomical restoration and functional outcomes, others report conflicting

results [33-35]. It is essential to consider the specific characteristics of the fracture, the patient's

circumstances, and their functional goals when making treatment decisions.

Risk-Benefit Considerations

The decision to pursue surgical or non-surgical treatment for calcaneal fractures should consider each

approach's potential risks and benefits. Surgical treatment may be associated with a higher risk of

complications, such as infection, nerve damage, and prolonged recovery time. Still, it may also lead to better

anatomical restoration and functional outcomes in some instances [33,35]. Non-surgical approaches may be

associated with a lower risk of complications. Still, they may not always result in optimal anatomical and

functional outcomes, especially in severe displacement or intra-articular involvement [34]. Therefore, the

decision should be individualised based on the specific characteristics of the fracture and the patient's goals

and preferences.

Postoperative care

Rehabilitation Protocols After Surgery

Early mobilisation: Early mobilisation is a critical component of postoperative care, aiming to prevent

stiffness and promote joint function. Initiating mobilisation within the limits of surgical fixation helps

maintain joint flexibility and prevent the development of contractures. Early mobilisation may initially

involve non-weight-bearing or partial weight-bearing activities, gradually progressing as the patient's

recovery allows. This proactive approach supports a quicker return to functional activities and helps prevent

complications associated with prolonged immobilisation [36].

Physiotherapy sessions: Structured physiotherapy sessions are integral to the postoperative care plan for

calcaneal fractures. These sessions address specific rehabilitation goals, focusing on restoring range of

motion, building strength, and improving functional mobility. Physiotherapists tailor exercises to the

individual patient's needs, taking into account the type and severity of the fracture and the surgical

interventions performed. Regular physiotherapy promotes optimal recovery and ensures the patient achieves

the milestones for successful rehabilitation [17].

Protected weight-bearing: The transition from non-weight-bearing to partial weight-bearing and eventually

full weight-bearing is a gradual process guided by the treating orthopaedic team. Protected weight-bearing

protocols are implemented to avoid excessive stress on the surgically reconstructed calcaneus during the

initial phases of rehabilitation. This cautious approach minimises the risk of complications and supports the

healing process. Close collaboration between patients and healthcare providers is crucial to ensure

adherence to weight-bearing restrictions and promote a safe recovery [19].

Gait training: Gait training is essential to rehabilitation following calcaneal fracture surgery. Ensuring a

proper and efficient walking pattern prevents gait abnormalities and associated complications. Gait training

focuses on restoring a typical walking pattern, optimising weight distribution, and promoting balance. This

aspect of rehabilitation plays a vital role in facilitating a smooth transition from protected weight-bearing to

full weight-bearing. It ultimately enables patients to regain confidence in their walking abilities [37].

2024 Chirayath et al. Cureus 16(2): e54786. DOI 10.7759/cureus.54786 7 of 14

Monitoring and adjusting rehabilitation plan: Regular monitoring of the patient's progress allows for

adjustments to the rehabilitation plan based on individual responses and healing trajectories. Healthcare

providers assess pain levels, range of motion, and strength during follow-up appointments. Modifications to

the rehabilitation plan may be made to address any challenges or to advance the intensity of exercises as the

patient's condition improves. This dynamic and personalised approach ensures that the rehabilitation plan

remains aligned with the patient's evolving needs, optimising the chances of a successful recovery [38].

Monitoring for Complications

Wound care: Vigilant wound care is paramount in the postoperative period following calcaneal fracture

surgery. Continuous monitoring of the surgical incision site is essential to detect any signs of infection,

delayed healing, or other wound-related issues. This includes assessing for redness, swelling, increased

warmth, or discharge. Timely intervention in response to any concerning signs ensures proper wound

healing and reduces the risk of complications [39].

Hardware integrity: Regular assessment of the stability and integrity of the fixation hardware is crucial to

identify any signs of loosening or complications. This involves reviewing imaging studies, such as X-rays, to

evaluate the positioning and condition of screws, plates, or other fixation devices. Monitoring hardware

integrity helps prevent potential issues related to instability, malunion, or irritation, ensuring the

effectiveness of the surgical reconstruction [40].

Neurovascular checks: Ongoing neurovascular checks involve monitoring for changes in the affected foot's

sensation, circulation, or motor function. These checks are essential to detect potential neurovascular

complications, such as nerve impingement or vascular compromise, which can occur during or after surgery.

Regular assessments contribute to the early identification of any abnormalities, allowing for prompt

intervention to prevent further complications [41].

Inflammatory response: Monitoring for excessive inflammation or signs of a postoperative inflammatory

response is crucial. Persistent or worsening inflammation may indicate complications such as infection or an

adverse reaction to hardware. If necessary, regular clinical assessments and laboratory tests help healthcare

providers gauge the inflammatory status and take appropriate measures to address any underlying issues

[42].

Functional progress: Regular evaluation of the patient's functional progress is integral to assessing the

effectiveness of rehabilitation. This includes monitoring the range of motion, strength, and gait. Tracking

functional improvements helps ensure steady progress and identifies any setbacks or challenges that may

require adjustments to the rehabilitation plan. This comprehensive assessment supports achieving optimal

functional outcomes for patients recovering from calcaneal fracture surgery [43].

Long-Term Follow-Up Considerations

Imaging studies: Periodic imaging studies, such as X-rays or CT scans, play a crucial role in the long-term

follow-up of patients who have undergone calcaneal fracture surgery. These studies are conducted to assess

the healing progress of the fracture, identify any hardware-related issues such as loosening or migration, and

monitor for the development of post-traumatic arthritis. Regular imaging provides valuable insights into the

structural integrity of the calcaneus and assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions regarding

ongoing management or potential interventions [3].

Functional assessments: Long-term follow-up should include functional assessments to gauge the patient's

ability to perform daily activities and participate in recreational or vocational pursuits. Functional

assessments thoroughly evaluate a range of motion, strength, gait, and overall mobility. Monitoring

functional outcomes helps healthcare providers tailor rehabilitation strategies, address persistent functional

limitations, and optimise the patient's overall quality of life in the extended postoperative period [44].

Pain management: Continued monitoring and management of pain, if present, remain essential

components of long-term follow-up. Chronic pain issues related to the calcaneal fracture or its surgical

intervention may persist, impacting the patient's daily activities and overall well-being. Ongoing pain

management strategies, including medication adjustments, physical therapy, or other interventions, aim to

enhance the patient's quality of life and provide sustained relief from any lingering discomfort [45].

Patient education: Providing ongoing education to the patient is crucial during long-term follow-up. This

involves discussing and reinforcing long-term expectations, potential limitations, and strategies for

maintaining foot health. Patient education contributes to informed decision-making, encourages adherence

to recommended lifestyle modifications, and empowers individuals to participate actively in their ongoing

care. Clear communication about the anticipated trajectory of recovery and potential challenges enhances

the patient's understanding and involvement in the long-term management process [46].

2024 Chirayath et al. Cureus 16(2): e54786. DOI 10.7759/cureus.54786 8 of 14

Screening for complications: Long-term follow-up includes vigilant screening for potential complications

that may arise after calcaneal fracture surgery. This involves assessing for conditions such as osteomyelitis,

arthritis, or malunion. Early identification of complications enables timely intervention and appropriate

management strategies. Regular screenings may include clinical examinations, imaging studies, and other

diagnostic tests, allowing healthcare providers to address complications promptly and optimise long-term

Recent advances and emerging technologies

Innovations in Surgical Techniques

Minimally invasive surgery (MIS): Advances in MIS techniques for calcaneal fractures represent a paradigm

shift in surgical intervention approaches. Compared to traditional open procedures, MIS minimises soft

tissue trauma, reduces scarring, and expedites recovery. Percutaneous fixation methods, including

arthroscopy-assisted procedures, are at the forefront of MIS for calcaneal fractures. These techniques

involve smaller incisions, allowing specialised instruments and implants to be inserted with the guidance of

imaging technologies. By reducing the extent of soft tissue disruption, MIS endeavours to achieve stable

fracture fixation while potentially decreasing complications associated with open procedures [48].

Computer-assisted surgery (CAS): Integrating CAS has significantly enhanced the precision and accuracy of

surgical interventions for calcaneal fractures. CAS involves using navigation systems that provide real-time

feedback to surgeons during the procedure. This technology aids in fracture reduction and implant

placement, improving the overall accuracy of the surgical process. By enhancing the surgeon's ability to

navigate complex anatomical structures, CAS contributes to more precise interventions, potentially

reducing the risk of complications and optimising the outcomes of calcaneal fracture surgeries [49].

3D printing technology: 3D printing technology has introduced a personalised dimension to the

management of calcaneal fractures. This innovative approach allows for the creation of patient-specific

implants and surgical guides. By leveraging detailed imaging data, surgeons can design implants tailored to

the patient's unique anatomy. Patient-specific surgical guides assist in accurate implant placement during

surgery. This personalised approach optimises anatomical fit, potentially improving stability and reducing

the risk of complications. 3D printing technology represents a cutting-edge tool that aligns with the

principles of precision medicine, offering customised solutions for calcaneal fracture management [50].

New Materials for Fixation

Biodegradable implants: The exploration of biodegradable implants, crafted from materials like polylactic

acid, represents a significant advancement in orthopaedic surgery, including calcaneal fracture

management. These implants are designed to degrade over time within the body gradually. This innovative

approach can eliminate secondary removal surgery, a common requirement with traditional metallic

implants. By minimising the risk of long-term complications associated with implant retention,

biodegradable implants offer a patient-friendly solution that aligns with sustainability principles and

reduces invasiveness [51].

Advanced biocompatible materials: The development of implants using advanced biocompatible materials

aims to improve the overall compatibility between the implant and the patient's body. This innovation

focuses on reducing the risk of adverse reactions, such as inflammation or rejection, and enhancing the

integration of the implant with the surrounding bone tissue. Utilising materials with superior

biocompatibility contributes to a more favourable healing environment, potentially lowering the incidence

of complications related to immune responses or implant-related inflammation [52].

Nitinol fixation devices: Nitinol, a shape memory alloy composed of nickel and titanium, is gaining

attention for its unique mechanical properties. Nitinol fixation devices are being explored for their ability to

provide dynamic stabilisation in orthopaedic applications, including calcaneal fractures. Nitinol's distinctive

shape memory property allows these devices to adapt to changes in load and temperature, providing a more

physiological response to biomechanical stresses. The dynamic nature of nitinol fixation devices may

contribute to improved long-term outcomes and enhanced patient comfort by facilitating a more natural

response to the forces acting on the calcaneus during weight-bearing activities [53].

Rehabilitation Strategies

Virtual reality (VR) rehabilitation: Integrating VR technology into rehabilitation programs for calcaneal

fractures represents a cutting-edge approach to enhance patient engagement and outcomes. VR offers

interactive and immersive exercises that simulate real-world scenarios, providing a novel and engaging

platform for rehabilitation. By creating a virtual environment tailored to the patient's needs, VR technology

encourages active exercise participation, potentially improving compliance and motivation during recovery.

This innovative approach not only adds a dynamic element to rehabilitation but also has the potential to

accelerate functional recovery and improve overall patient satisfaction [54].

rehabilitation plans, ensuring that exercises are targeted, effective, and aligned with the individual patient's

progress. Integrating sensor-based rehabilitation devices offers a data-driven approach to rehabilitation,

optimising outcomes through personalised and adaptive interventions [55].

Tele-rehabilitation services: Integrating Tele-rehabilitation services leverages technology to extend

rehabilitation beyond the traditional clinical setting. Patients can access rehabilitation services remotely,

enabling ongoing care and monitoring. This approach is precious for individuals in rural or remote locations

who may face challenges accessing regular in-person rehabilitation sessions. Tele-rehabilitation facilitates

real-time communication between patients and healthcare providers, allowing for remote assessments,

exercise guidance, and progress monitoring. This technology-driven approach enhances accessibility and

continuity of care, ultimately improving patient outcomes [56].

Biomechanical analysis tools: Advanced biomechanical analysis tools are pivotal in rehabilitating calcaneal

fractures by providing detailed insights into gait and movement patterns. These tools enable a thorough

biomechanics assessment, allowing healthcare providers to identify specific functional deficits and tailor

rehabilitation plans accordingly. By analyzing factors such as joint kinematics, ground reaction forces, and

muscle activation patterns, biomechanical analysis tools contribute to a more precise understanding of the

patient's movement mechanics. This information informs targeted interventions to address specific

challenges, optimising the effectiveness of rehabilitation and promoting a more seamless return to normal

activities [57].

Patient education and counselling

Importance of Patient Compliance

Adherence to rehabilitation protocols: Emphasising the importance of strict adherence to prescribed

rehabilitation protocols is a cornerstone of successful recovery following calcaneal fractures. Patient

compliance with exercises, weight-bearing restrictions, and activity modifications significantly influence the

long-term outcomes of fracture management. Reinforcing the rationale behind each aspect of the

rehabilitation plan helps patients understand their critical role in their recovery. Clear communication and

ongoing support from healthcare providers contribute to improved adherence, facilitating optimal healing

and functional restoration [58].

Medication management: Ensuring patients understand the necessity of adhering to medication regimens is

vital for adequate pain control and healing. This includes pain management medications and any prescribed

anti-inflammatory drugs. Educating patients about the purpose of each medication, potential side effects,

and the importance of following the prescribed dosage schedule enhances medication compliance.

Addressing patients' concerns or questions about their medications fosters a collaborative approach to pain

management, contributing to overall well-being during recovery [59].

Follow-up appointments: Stressing the significance of attending scheduled follow-up appointments with

healthcare providers is essential for the comprehensive management of calcaneal fractures. Follow-up

appointments allow for ongoing assessment of the healing process, adjustment of treatment plans based on

progress, and early identification of potential complications. Regular monitoring enables healthcare

providers to address evolving patient needs, ensuring the recovery trajectory remains on course. Clear

communication regarding the importance of follow-up appointments encourages patients to participate

actively in their ongoing care and promotes optimal long-term outcomes [60].

Weight-bearing restrictions: Communicating the importance of adhering to weight-bearing restrictions,

especially during the initial stages of recovery, is critical to prevent strain on the healing calcaneus and to

avoid potential setbacks. Patients must understand the rationale behind these restrictions and their impact

on the surgical intervention's stability and success. Reinforcing the need for gradual progression from non￾weight-bearing to partial and eventually complete weight-bearing aligns with the principles of safe

rehabilitation. Clear instructions and ongoing education empower patients to make informed decisions that

support the healing process and minimise the risk of complications [61].

Expectations During Recovery

Timeline for healing: Providing patients with a realistic timeline for recovery is essential to managing

expectations and fostering informed decision-making. Communicating that the healing process for

calcaneal fractures may be gradual and that improvement may continue over an extended period helps

patients understand the nature of their recovery. This information empowers patients to navigate

rehabilitation with patience and persistence, reducing anxiety and promoting a positive mindset [62].

2024 Chirayath et al. Cureus 16(2): e54786. DOI 10.7759/cureus.54786 10 of 14

Functional milestones: Outlining expected functional milestones is crucial for patients to gauge their

progress and understand their recovery trajectory. These milestones may include bearing weight, returning

to normal activities, and achieving optimal range of motion. Communicating these benchmarks allows

patients to track their achievements, motivating adherence to the rehabilitation plan. Clear expectations

regarding functional milestones contribute to a sense of accomplishment and provide tangible goals for

patients throughout the recovery process [63].

Potential setbacks: Educating patients about potential setbacks is integral to preparing them for the

challenges that may arise during recovery. This includes discussing the possibility of temporary increases in

pain, challenges during rehabilitation, or variations in progress. Providing this information helps patients

mentally and emotionally prepare for the ups and downs of recovery. Additionally, it encourages open

communication between patients and healthcare providers, fostering a collaborative approach to

overcoming setbacks and optimising outcomes [64].

Return to work and activities: Discussing the anticipated timeline for returning to work and regular

activities is crucial for patients to plan their recovery journey effectively. Clear communication about when

they can expect to resume daily tasks and work responsibilities allows patients to adjust their lives. This

information assists in setting realistic expectations for the pace of recovery, helping patients navigate the

transition from rehabilitation to full participation in their usual activities [65].

Lifestyle Modifications

Footwear choices: Advising patients on appropriate footwear is crucial to post-calcaneal fracture care.

Recommending shoes that provide adequate support and minimise stress on the foot is essential for

optimising the healing process. Encouraging the use of orthopaedic shoes or inserts can provide additional

support and comfort during recovery. This guidance helps patients make informed choices that align with

their rehabilitation goals and reduce the risk of injury exacerbation through inappropriate footwear [66].

Physical activity guidelines: Discussing modified physical activity guidelines is essential for preventing re￾injury and supporting ongoing healing. Patients need clear guidance on avoiding high-impact activities that

may strain the healing calcaneus. Gradually reintroducing exercise in a controlled manner helps ensure a

progressive return to normal physical activities without compromising the recovery. Personalised

recommendations based on the patient's condition contribute to a safe and effective rehabilitation plan [67].

Nutrition and hydration: Emphasising the role of nutrition in bone health and healing is crucial for patients

recovering from calcaneal fractures. Encouraging a balanced diet rich in vitamins and minerals essential for

bone health, such as calcium and vitamin D, contributes to overall recovery. Adequate hydration is also

essential for supporting the body's healing processes. Nutrition education empowers patients to make

dietary choices that promote optimal bone healing and overall well-being during recovery [68].

Smoking cessation: For patients who smoke, emphasising the importance of smoking cessation is a vital

aspect of comprehensive care. Smoking has been associated with impaired bone healing and an increased

risk of complications following fractures. Communicating the potential negative impact of smoking on the

healing process motivates patients to make this critical lifestyle modification. Smoking cessation supports

calcaneal fracture recovery and improves overall health and well-being [69].

Conclusions

In conclusion, the comprehensive review of calcaneal fractures underscores the intricacies of their

management, encompassing both surgical and non-surgical modalities. Recognising common causes, risk

factors, and types of calcaneal fractures provides a foundational understanding essential for accurate

diagnosis. Surgical interventions, guided by indications and timing considerations, have evolved with

innovations such as minimally invasive techniques, computer-assisted surgery, and novel fixation materials.

Concurrently, non-surgical approaches, including rehabilitation strategies and patient education, are pivotal

in optimising outcomes. Patient compliance with prescribed protocols emerges as a linchpin for successful

recovery, emphasising the importance of diligent postoperative care and long-term follow-up.

Recommendations for clinical practice highlight the need for individualised approaches and

multidisciplinary collaboration. Future research avenues, spanning biomechanics, regenerative therapies,

and telerehabilitation, hold promise in refining current practices and enhancing the overall landscape of

calcaneal fracture management. As we reflect on the past and look forward, this comprehensive exploration

aims to contribute to the ongoing refinement of clinical strategies, ultimately improving the quality of care

and outcomes for individuals grappling with calcaneal fractures.

Abstract: Objectives: This research explored and analyzed the effects of early partial weight-bearing rehabilitative 

exercise on postoperative recovery after Sanders IV calcaneal fractures. Methods: 86 patients hospitalized with 

Sanders IV calcaneal fracture from April 2018 to January 2020 were selected as the research participants. The 

patients were randomly divided into the observation group (n=44) and the control group (n=42). The control group 

carried out the conventional rehabilitative exercise, and the observation group underwent early partial weight-bear￾ing rehabilitative exercise. The foot function between the two groups was compared after 24 weeks of treatment. 

Results: The foot function of the observation group after 24 weeks of treatment was notably superior to that of the 

control group (P<0.05). The Maryland foot function scores of the two groups 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks 

post-operation were critically higher than those before treatment (P<0.05), and the score of the observation group 

was substantially higher than that of the control group (P<0.05). The AOFAS score of patients in the two groups 6 

weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks post-operation increased apparently than that before treatment (P<0.05), and the 

scores of observation group was evidently higher than that of control group (P<0.05). In addition, the comparison 

of Angle B’hler and Angle Gissane between the two groups of patients 24 weeks postoperation showed statistically 

insignificant difference (P>0.05). Conclusion: The early partial weight-bearing rehabilitative exercise can effectively 

promote the postoperative functional recovery of patients with Sander IV calcaneal fractures, and at the same time 

it has no impact on internal fixation and calcaneus shape of patients, which is worthy popularizing in clinic.

Introduction

There are a total of seven tarsal bones in 

human body. Among which, calcaneus is the 

largest tarsal bone, and bears about 40% of 

the body weight when walking and loading [1]. 

Calcaneal fractures are particularly common in 

clinical work, and it accounts for 60% of tarsal 

fractures and 2% of total body fractures. The 

anatomical structure of calcaneus is special 

and complex, and the mechanism of calcaneal 

injury and fracture types are numerous. In addi￾tion, as the foot function is connected with a 

variety of factors such as the shape, anatomi￾cal angle and the relative position, it is difficult 

to achieve anatomical reduction, and usually 

results in unsatisfactory therapeutic effects [2, 

3]. Studies have shown [4] that about 75% of 

patients have experienced foot dysfunction, 

and for those with severely injured the disa￾bility rate is as high as 30%. Many patients 

had good surgical reduction, but failed for the 

recovery of foot function due to the lack of 

effective postoperative functional exercise. 

Besides, there still exist controversies about 

postoperative weight-bearing functional exer￾cise [5]. In order to further improve the postop￾erative recovery of foot function after Sanders 

IV calcaneal fracture, we explored and analyzed 

the effects of early partial weight-bearing reha￾bilitative exercise exerted to the disease. The 

details are stated as follows:

Materials and methods

Research objects

86 patients, hospitalized with Sanders IV calca￾neal fracture from April 2018 to January 2020, 

were selected as the research participants. 

They were randomly divided into the observa￾tion group (n=44) and the control group (n=42) 

according to random number table. The study 

was approved by the ethics committee of our 

hospital.

Inclusive criteria

(1) The diagnostic criteria of patients were in 

accordance with Sanders IV calcaneal fracture 

in Bone and Joint Injury, and the type was fresh 

simple fracture [6]; (2) All patients had under￾gone open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) 

with steel plate; (3) Patients aged between 

18-60 years; (4) Patients had voluntarily signed 

informed consent.

Exclusive criteria

(1) Patients with Sanders I, II, III calcaneal frac￾tures; (2) Patients with injuries of vital nerves, 

blood vessels or ligaments; (3) Patients with 

immune system diseases, endocrine system 

diseases, etc.; (4) Patients with dysfunctions of 

heart, brain, liver or kidney; or (5) Patients with 

mental disorders.

Methods

The control group carried out the regular reha￾bilitation exercises, and the specific process 

were as follows: (1) The main treatment from 

the first day to the second week after surgery 

was to reduce swelling. The patient raised the 

injured foot and began to perform passive toe 

movements 24 hours after operation. The 

exercise was required to perform in maximum 

range, 3-5 times/group and 6 groups a day. (2) 

In the 3rd to 6th week after the operation, the 

patients continued the above exercises and 

conducted gentle active and passive ex￾ercises of ankle and subtalar joints. The 

patients were asked to extend their back or 

plantar flexion as long as they can tolerate, and 

maintained for 20 seconds. The exercise was 

set by 3 to 5 times/group, and 6 groups per 

day. (3) The patients continued to expand the 

range of motion in ankle joint during 2-7 weeks 

postoperation. They underwent joint mobiliza￾tion of subtalar joint, calcaneocubic joint, and 

talar navicular joint, and passively moved the 

subtalar joint to gradually restore the range of 

motion for the three joints. Meanwhile, we 

adopted the unarmed resistant technique to 

perform isometric exercises on patients’ poste￾rior tibial muscle, tibial anterior muscle, and 

tibial long brevis muscle in order to strengthen 

the patients’ muscles strength around their 

ankle joints. (4) According to fracture degree, 

the patients performed the partial weight-bear￾ing standing or walking in the 13th to 24th 

weeks after surgery, and gradually increased 

the exercise intensity to full weight-bearing. 

The proprioceptive training of patients was car￾ried out by shaking board, so that the patients’ 

proprioceptive system of ankle and foot can be 

recovered; For gait training, it started by shift￾ing the center of gravity left/right and front/

back between the legs; For walking practice, 

the patients were required to reach the equal 

support of both feet and same extent in swing 

phase, until the normal walking gait can be 

restored.

The observation group conducted the partial 

weight-bearing rehabilitative exercise, and the 

specific training program was as follows: The 

rehabilitative trainings for joint activity, muscle 

strength and proprioception were the same as 

those conducted by the control group. While 

starting from the 4th week postoperatively, 

these patients received partial weight-bearing 

training as well. The patients held the parallel 

rod with both hands, and put the mass measur￾ing instrument under feet to experience the 

loading weight they can tolerate. The patient’s 

initial loading weight was 25% of his body 

mass, which ranged from 10 to 20 kg, and then 

increased progressively. The patients looked 

straight and walked with crutches in a three￾point manner, and started to stand or walk with 

full weight 13 weeks after surgery.

Observation of indexes

The Maryland foot function scores, including 

pain and function, were compared between the 

two groups before surgery, and 6 weeks, 12 

weeks, and 24 weeks after surgery [7]. The 

scale has a full score of 100 points, and the 

higher score referred to the better foot func￾tion. For the earned score, 90-100 is consid-

ered as excellent foot function, 75-89 as good, 

50-74 as fair, and <50 as poor foot function.

The AOFAS scores of the two groups before sur￾gery, and 6 weeks, 12 weeks and 24 weeks 

after surgery were compared [8]. The AOFAS 

score includes the dimensions of daily activity 

function, pain and imaging that comprehen￾sively evaluate the patient’s ankle function 

recovery, and the full score is 100 points. The 

higher AOFAS score of patients reflects the bet￾ter ankle functions.

The differences of Angle B’hler and Gissane 

between the two groups 24 weeks postopera￾tion were compared.

Statistical analysis

The analysis of data was processed by SPSS 

22.0. The comparison of measurement data 

was done by t-test, enumeration data by χ2 test, 

and ordinal data by Kruskal-Wallis test. The sta￾tistically significant difference was set by 

P<0.05. The graphic software adopted was 

Graphpad prism.

Discussion

Calcaneus fracture is one of the most common 

types of tarsal fractures. Most calcaneal frac￾tures are caused by a fall from a height or a 

vertical impact on the heel after the foot hits 

the ground. Orthopedic clinicians have con￾ducted in-depth researches on the types of 

calcaneal fractures, operation timing, incision 

positioning, and internal fixation, but there are 

still patients who have not achieved good reha￾bilitative results. In recent years, an increasing 

number of scholars have focused on the post￾operative rehabilitative exercise on foot func￾tion recovery of patients with calcaneal 

fractures [9, 10]. Wound complications and 

postoperative recovery of joint function are 

two major problems in the treatment of calca￾neal fractures. As we all know, anatomical 

reduction and rigid internal fixation are the 

basis for achieving ideal treatment effect, and 

the active rehabilitation exercise after surgery 

is also a crucial part that impacts the re￾covery of joint function [11]. The articular sur￾faces of calcaneus and talus, anterior, middle 

and heel constitute the special structure of the 

subtalar joint. After calcaneal fracture, the 

anastomosis with the surrounding small joints 

will be affected, and varying degrees of ankle 

dysfunction in ankle joint will be caused [12, 

13]. The prolonged immobilization during peri￾Table 3. Comparison of Maryland foot function score between the two groups before and after treat￾ment (points, _

Postoperative exercise for sanders type IV calcaneal fracture

8320 Am J Transl Res 2021;13(7):8316-8322

operative period may lead to capsular contrac￾ture, muscle atrophy and osteoporosis, and 

result in ankle stiffness, foot pain and discom￾fort [14]. Studies reported by other scholars 

[15, 16] revealed that early rehabilitative exer￾cise could effectively reduce the postoperative 

wound infection and promote the recovery of 

ankle joint function. In addition, studies have 

shown that effective postoperative rehabilita￾tion exercise can promote the regression of 

body swelling, and accelerate the absorption 

of inflammatory factors. Meanwhile, the active 

rehabilitation exercise can avoid the arthrogry￾posis of Achilles tendon, and the injuries to the 

motion range of important adjacent joints in 

each axis caused by adhesion of ankle joint, 

and provide a good basis for the recovery of 

patient’s postoperative functions [17, 18].

In recent years, there is still a great contro￾versy about whether to carry out early weight￾bearing rehabilitative exercise for calcaneal 

fractures with articular surface damage. Some 

scholars held that early weight-bearing exer￾cise after calcaneal fracture may increase the 

risk of collapse of the subtalar articular sur￾face. Others shared that early weight-bearing 

exercise will not cause the displacement of 

fractures and affect the stability of internal 

fixation, but can promote the postoperative 

functional recovery of patients and reduce the 

risk of osteoporosis [19-21]. In this research, 

the effects of early partial weight-bearing reha￾bilitative exercise on postoperative recovery of 

tially better than those of the control group. 

These results are consistent with the findings 

of other scholars [22, 23], suggesting that 

early partial weight-bearing rehabilitative exer￾cise can effectively promote the rehabilitation 

of patients. The exercise is beneficial to the 

recovery of muscle strength and body circula￾tion, and is also beneficial to enhancing 

patients’ confidence in recovery of body func￾tion. In addition, the difference of Angle B’hler 

and Angle Gissane between the two groups of 

patients 24 weeks postoperation was statisti￾cally insignificant, indicating that the early 

partial weight-bearing rehabilitative exercise 

brings no impact to the fracture internal fix￾ation and calcaneus shape of patients with 

calcaneal fractures.

To conclude, the early partial weight-bearing 

rehabilitative exercise can effectively promote 

the postoperative functional recovery of pati￾ents with Sander IV calcaneal fractures, and at 

the same time has no impact on internal fixa￾tion and calcaneus shape of patients, which is 

worthy popularizing in clinic.

• Purpose: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to compare re-rupture 

rates, complication rates, functional outcomes, as well as return to work (RTW)/sport (RTS) 

among different rehabilitation protocols following operative treatment of acute Achilles 

tendon ruptures.

• Methods: Systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted according to the Preferred 

Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Five databases were 

searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing at least two rehabilitation 

protocols following surgical repair of acute Achilles tendon ruptures. Rehabilitation 

protocols were classified as a variation of either non-weightbearing (NWB) or weightbearing 

(WB) and immobilization (IM) or mobilization (M). The data collection consisted of 

re-ruptures, complications, and RTW/RTS.

• Results: Out of 2760 studies screened, 20 RCTs with 1007 patients were eligible. Fourteen 

studies included a group consisting of WB+M (Group 1), 11 of WB+IM (Group 2), 3 of 

NWB+M (Group 3), and 13 of NWB+IM (Group 4). Outcome parameters available for a 

meta-analysis were re-ruptures, complications, RTW, and RTS. Re-ruptures overall occurred 

in 2.7%, with prevalences ranging between 0.04 and 0.08. Major complications occurred in 

2.6%, with prevalences ranging between 0.02 and 0.03. Minor complications occurred in 

11.8% with prevalances ranging between 0.04 to 0.17. Comparing the odds-ratios between 

the four different groups revealed no significant differences with overall favourable results 

for group 1 (WB+M).

• Conclusion: Early functional rehabilitation protocols with early ankle M and WB following 

surgical repair of acute Achilles tendon ruptures are safe and they apparently allow for a 

quicker RTW and RTS and seem to lead to favourable results.

Background

Achilles tendon ruptures are common injuries (1, 2, 3, 4) and 

occur most frequently in young and active males around 

40 years old (1, 3, 4). Over the past few decades, treatment 

concepts (non-surgical/surgical and rehabilitation) have 

evolved considerably from non-surgical treatment to 

open reconstruction to minimally invasive techniques. The 

transition to surgical treatment was predominantly driven 

by lower re-rupture rates and better functional results but 

at the cost of higher rates of wound issues and surgical 

site infections (4, 5, 6). The implementation of minimally 

invasive techniques enabled surgeons to significantly 

decrease the risk of surgical site infections while maintaining 

the many advantages of surgery (7). Still, even surgically 

treated patients face a prolonged recovery, and all too 

often fail to reach pre-injury functional levels even if they 

do not suffer a re-rupture or complication first (8, 9, 10).

Postoperative rehabilitation protocols have evolved 

substantially from restrictive to more progressive. 

Postoperative rehabilitation protocols generally consist 

of two major components that exist on a binomial axis: 

non-weightbearing (NWB)/weightbearing (WB) and 

immobilization (IM)/mobilization (M) (10). Traditionally, 

patients were advised to maintain NWB for 6–8 weeks 

with IM in equinus position (11, 12). But these restrictive 

rehabilitation protocols have been shown to result in calf 

muscle atrophy and ankle joint stiffness. More progressive 

postoperative rehabilitation protocols have therefore been 

developed. It has been shown that progressive protocols 

have a pronounced influence on functional outcomes, 

including a faster return to work (RTW) and sports (RTW) 

(10, 13). Despite the considerable amount of literature 

on this topic, most physicians still facilitate restrictive 

postoperative rehabilitation protocols (10, 13).

In 2014, our study group conducted a systematic 

review on functional rehabilitation protocols. Based on 

12 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which only 

open surgical procedures were used, immediate full WB 

and controlled ankle M starting by week 3 seemed to 

be recommendable (14). However, due to the growing 

body of evidence (15) on the subject and the persistent 

hesitance of applying more progressive rehabilitation 

protocols, we conducted another systematic review, but 

this time in conjunction with a meta-analysis. The aim 

was to compare re-rupture rates, complication rates, 

functional outcomes, as well as RTW/RTS among different 

rehabilitation protocols following operative treatment of 

acute Achilles tendon ruptures.

Materials and methods

The systematic review was conducted according to the 

Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 

Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (16). The protocol was 

registered to Prospero (CRD42019136005).

Search strategy

MEDLINE (PubMed), CINAHL, Scopus, Central, and 

EMBASE were utilized as search engines from inception 

to May 28, 2019 (date of the database search). The 

search strategy is composed of three main concepts: 

Achilles tendon, rupture, and operative treatment. The 

different terms of each concept were combined with 

the OR operator and the three concepts were combined 

using the AND operator. The full search strategy for each 

database is provided in Supplementary Appendix 1 (see 

section on supplementary materials given at the end 

of this article). A grey literature search for conference 

proceedings in both Scopus and EMBASE was performed, 

and all references of the studies included were hand￾searched to identify studies that might have been missed 

by the systematic search.

Inclusion/exclusion criteria

The inclusion/exclusion criteria were designed according 

to the PICOS criteria (17) (Table 1). Studies eligible 

were randomized controlled studies comparing at least 

two different postoperative rehabilitation protocols in 

surgically treated, acute, isolated ruptures of the Achilles 

tendon which reported objective outcomes. Acute was 

defined as surgery within 14 days after injury (18). The 

type of surgical treatment (open, minimal invasive, 

or percutaneous) was of no matter. Studies must be 

published in German or English. Studies including patients 

with ruptures treated more than 2 weeks postinjury, 

re-ruptures, or with a mixed population were excluded.

Study selection and data extraction

Each database was searched separately, and the resulting 

datasets were exported to Endnote™ (version 20.1; Fa. 

Clarivate). Following removal of duplicates, the final 

dataset was exported to Covidence™ (Melbourne, 

Australia). Each step of study selection and data extraction 

was performed by two investigators independently. 

Disagreements were resolved by discussion with a third 

investigator.

Data extracted from each study was performed on 

predefined data extraction sheets including the following 

data points: study design, sample size, operative 

technique of tendon repair, description of rehabilitation 

protocol, time of follow-up, patient satisfaction, patient￾rated outcome measures (PROMS), functional assessment, 

time to RTW and RTS, tendon elongation, re-rupture, 

and complications. Data extraction was again performed 

by two blinded investigators independently and 

disagreements were again resolved by discussion with a 

third investigator.

Quality assessment

Quality assessment was conducted independently 

by two reviewers and disagreements were resolved 

by discussion with a third reviewer. Assessment was 

performed utilizing a modified version of the original 

Coleman Methodology Score (CMS; Table 2) (19, 20) 

and, for the risk of bias, the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for 

randomized trials (21).

Primary and secondary outcomes

Re-rupture rate was defined as the primary outcome 

measure. Secondary outcome measures included 

major and minor complications, time to RTW, time to 

RTS, and any PROMS or functional outcome measures. 

Complications were differentiated between minor and 

major complications. Minor complications included 

superficial wound infections, delayed wound healing, 

muscle stiffness, and mechanical irritations due to 

scarring or similar. Major complications included 

deep vein thrombosis, deep wound infections, loss of 

Achilles tendon, secondary flap coverage due to wound 

complications, or persisting sensory deficit/nerve 

damage.

Categorization of the different rehabilitation protocols

The rehabilitation protocols were grouped according 

to the M of the ankle and the permitted WB following 

the surgical treatment. ‘Weightbearing’ was defined 

as weightbearing on the operative leg within the first 4 

weeks following the surgery. ‘Non-weightbearing’ was 

defined as no weightbearing within the first 4 weeks. 

‘Mobilization’ was defined as any active or passive ankle 

movement within the first 4 weeks following the surgical 

treatment. ‘Immobilization’ was defined as rigid fixation of 

the ankle (equinus or neutral position). The resulting four 

groups of possible rehabilitation protocols are outlined 

in Table 3. The different protocols of each control and 

intervention group of each study are summarized in the 

Supplementary Appendix.

Statistical analysis

Outcomes that were reported in at least three publications 

were analysed. The prevalence with exact 95% CI from 

binomial distribution for binary outcomes was estimated 

for each study. Pooled prevalence with 95% CI across 

studies was calculated using inverse-variance method with 

random-effects model. The prevalence was calculated 

using RStudio (version 1.3, Boston, MA, USA).

A meta-analysis was conducted if three or more 

studies revealed sufficient comparability for the outcome 

parameters re-rupture rate and major and minor 

complications. The meta-analysis was conducted using 

Cochrane RevMan 5.4.1 (version 5.4. The Cochrane 

Collaboration). The chosen statistical method was 

the Mantel–Haenszel method, and the analysis model 

was a random-effects model. Odds ratios (ORs) were 

calculated between the different groups. I2 statistic was 

used to represent between studies heterogeneity which 

quantified the percentage of total variation across studies 

in study outcomes. Chi-square test was performed to 

test whether the true between-study variance is equal 

to zero (22).

(8, 9, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 40) a Group 

4 (NWB+IM) rehabilitation protocol. In these 20 RCTs, a 

total of 1007 patients were included with a mean age of 

39 years (range: 19–73 years, not stated in 2 studies (33, 

36)), 85% were male patients, and in 44%, the rupture 

occurred in the right leg (not stated in 9 studies (9, 26, 

28, 29, 32, 35, 36, 37, 40)). The mean follow-up period 

was 23.5 months (range: 3–132 months, not stated in 3 

studies (9, 28, 30)). The demographic data per treatment 

group are presented in Table 3.

An open reconstruction of the Achilles tendon was 

performed in 16 studies (8, 23, 24, 25, 28, 29, 30, 31, 

32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39), a percutaneous (9, 26, 

40) or minimal-invasive (27) technique in the remaining 

4 studies. Most studies (n =10; 50%) used Kessler or 

modified Kessler sutures (8, 28, 29, 30, 32, 33, 34, 35, 

37, 38). In the remaining studies, other suture techniques 

such as Bunell (31, 38) (n =2; 10%) or Krackow (36) (n =1; 

5%) were used or it was not stated (n =7; 35%).

Re-ruptures, major/minor complications, RTW, and 

RTS were commonly assessed and therefore available for 

further analysis. Various outcome scores were assessed at 

various time points throughout the studies. The Achilles 

Tendon Rupture Score (ATRS) (41) was the only score 

assessed by three or more studies at 1 year follow-up. The 

ATRS contains 10 different items of patient-rated outcome 

with scores ranging from 0 to 10 points. These 10 items 

add up to a possible total score of 100 points, which 

represents the best functional result.

Study quality

The mean modified CMS (19, 20) was 73.3 ± 13.0 points 

(range: 48–87points) (Table 4). Based on the Cochrane 

risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials, 16 studies were 

overall rated as ‘some concerns’ and 4 as ‘high risk’ of 

bias, all due to an unclear allocation sequence during 

randomization of the patients (Fig. 2).

Primary outcome – re-ruptures

Seventeen studies (85%) reported an overall re-rupture 

rate of 2.7% (25 of 913). The group-specific prevalences 

are presented in Table 4. Overall, Group 1 had the lowest 

prevalence for re-rupture (0.04; 95% CI: 0.02–0.06). For 

all groups, a low heterogeneity (I2=0%; P =0.38–0.96) 

was found.

Forest plots of the estimated OR for re-rupture rates 

(Fig. 3) were calculated for studies directly comparing 

similar rehabilitation groups (Table 4). Four studies 

compared Group 1 (WB+M) to Group 2 (WB+IM) with a 

non-significant OR of 0.63 (95% CI: 0.16–2.55; P=0.520) 

in favour for Group 1. All studies used an open surgical 

repair. Seven studies compared Group 1 (WB+M) to 

Group 4 (NWB+IM), again, with a non-significant OR of 

0.61 (95% CI: 0.15–2.47; P=0.490) in favour of Group 

1, based on 4 studies reporting events. An open repair 

was used in half of the studies, while the other half used 

a minimally invasive technique. Four studies compared 

Group 2 (WB+IM) to Group 4 (NWB+IM) with a non￾significant OR of 2.13 (95% CI: 0.33–13.61; P=0.420) 

in favour for Group 4, based on 3 studies reporting 

events. All studies used an open surgical repair. Again, a 

low heterogeneity was found for all three comparisons 

(I2=0%; P =0.28–0.49).

Secondary outcome

Major complications

Seventeen studies (85%) reported a total of 2.6% 

(23 of 913) major complications. The group-specific 

prevalences are presented in Table 3, with Group 1 

having the lowest prevalence for a major complication 

(0.02; 95% CI: 0.01–0.03). The overall risk of bias was 

low (I2 = 0%; P = 0.75–0.94).

Second, a meta-analysis on major complications 

was conducted for studies directly comparing similar 

rehabilitation groups (Fig. 4). Four studies compared 

Group 1 (WB +M) to Group 2 (WB + IM) with an OR of 

0.97 (95% CI: 0.21–4.52; P = 0.960) based on three 

studies reporting events. Six studies compared Group 

1 (WB +M) to Group 4 (NWB + IM), with two studies 

not reporting events, and a non-significant OR of 0.82 

(95% CI: 0.24–2.83; P = 0.750) in favour of Group 1. 

Both comparisons revealed a low level of heterogeneity 

(I2 = 0; P = 0.620, P = 0.520). For the remaining groups, 

no cumulative analysis could be performed. A specific 

analysis in regard to open or minimally invasive surgical 

technique was not possible.

Minor complications

Seventeen studies reported minor complications in 11.8% 

(108 of 913) of patients. The group-specific prevalences 

are presented in Table 4, with Group 1 revealing the 

lowest prevalence for a minor complication (0.04; 95% CI: 

0.02–0.07) at a moderate level of heterogeneity (I2=49% 

84%; P =0.0011–0.03).

A group comparing meta-analysis could only be 

conducted for Group 2 vs Group 4 (Fig. 5), reporting 

no relevant differences (OR: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.47–

1.96; P=0.910) between the 4 studies included at no 

heterogeneity (I2 = 0%; P=0.750).

Return to work and sports

Seven/six studies reported the time to RTW (23, 24, 26, 

27, 33, 34, 35)/RTS (24, 25, 31, 33, 34, 35). The individual 

studies and significant differences are outlined in Table 5. 

Due to the varying data value presentation in the individual 

manuscripts, no pooled statistical analysis could be 

performed. Overall, Group 4 revealed the poorest results 

for RTW and RTS.

Achilles Tendon Rupture Scores

The ATRS assessed at 12 months follow-up was reported 

in three studies (8, 36, 37). No study reported significant 

differences between the treatment groups (Table 5). Due 

to the limited number of studies within each group, no 

cumulative analysis could be conducted.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis was based on 20 

RCTs; all eligible of which were grouped according to their 

postoperative rehabilitation protocols (WB/NWB and M/

IM). Unfortunately, considerable interstudy heterogeneity 

was observed regarding the assessment of objective 

functional outcome parameters. Even if comparable 

scores/parameters were assessed, the time points of the 

assessment and/or the means of the assessment differed 

considerably. Therefore, a quantitative analysis did not 

seem appropriate for the functional outcome parameters, 

although it was possible for complications. The ORs for 

re-rupture rate and major and minor complications did 

not differ significantly among the different rehabilitation 

groups. However, early WB and M (Group 1) had the 

lowest prevalence and the most favourable outcomes 

for re-rupture rates, major complication, and minor 

complication.

A first meta-analysis on this topic by Suchak et al. in 

2006 (42) found early functional rehabilitation protocols 

to improve patient satisfaction without increasing the 

re-rupture rate. However, the analysis was limited to six 

RCTs with a total of 315 patients. In 2015, McCormack 

and Bovard published a meta-analysis based on 10 RCTs 

comprising 570 patients comparing bracing to casting 

Figure 3

(43). No significant differences were found for major 

complications. Further outcome parameters assessed, all 

in favour of the bracing group, were RTW, RTS, patient 

satisfaction, and functional outcome. Still, the authors 

did not differentiate for the allowed WB and reported a 

high level of heterogeneity. In 2014, our study group 

published a systematic literature review to propose an 

evidence-based rehabilitation protocol for surgically 

treated Achilles tendon ruptures (14). Based on 12 RCTs, 

we found higher satisfaction, earlier return to pre-injury 

activities, and superior functional outcomes for full WB 

and early ankle M. The current systematic review 5 years 

later has identified 20 eligible RCTs with a total of 1007 

patients. To the authors’ best knowledge, the current 

systematic review includes the largest number of RCTs 

and patients specifically investigating the effect of the 

rehabilitation regime in surgically treated acute Achilles 

tendon ruptures. Still, the applied rehabilitation protocols 

varied considerably from NWB and IM for a period of 

over 6 weeks (23) to immediate WB and early ankle M 

(39). In order to allow for a principal comparison, the 

different rehabilitation protocols were grouped into

four basic rehabilitation protocols (Table 3). Despite the 

considerable number of RCTs included and the broad 

categorization, no further cumulative statistical analysis 

could be conducted for patient satisfaction, patient-rated 

outcome, or functional outcome parameters due to the 

considerable variation in how and when these parameters 

were assessed in the individual RCTs.

Our meta-analysis found no significant differences 

in re-rupture rates, major complication, or minor 

complication between the four different rehabilitation 

protocol groups. The most progressive rehabilitation 

protocol (Group 1) appeared slightly superior to the other 

protocols with respect to the risk of complications and 

re-rupture. Accelerated rehabilitation protocols have now 

even been implemented for nonoperative management 

of acute Achilles tendon ruptures. Several recent meta￾analyses compared accelerated rehabilitation to delayed 

rehabilitation protocols (44, 45, 46). Similar to our 

study, they found no differences between the different 

rehabilitation regimes for re-rupture rate or complications. 

Therefore, accelerated functional rehabilitation protocols 

following surgical treatment of Achilles tendon ruptures 

can be considered safe.

Whether accelerated functional rehabilitation protocols 

also have a functional advantage remains a matter of 

debate. In line with the meta-analysis by McCormack 

and Bovard (43), more aggressive rehabilitation appears 

to have a beneficial effect on RTW and RTS. The only 

patient-reported outcome score that allowed a limited 

analysis was the ATRS at 1 year follow-up, which was 

assessed by three studies (8, 36, 37). These could not 

find any significant differences between the different 

rehabilitation protocols.

Several limitations need to be considered. First, 

relevant papers might have been missed by our search 

strategy, exhaustive though it was. To reduce this 

selection bias, a clearly defined search strategy was 

applied to five databases, a grey literature search 

was included, and the abstract/paper screening was 

conducted by two independent reviewers. Next, 

the conclusions of this systematic review are limited 

somewhat by the heterogenous quality of the studies 

included. The modified CMS varied between 48 and 87 

points (average 72.9 ± 12.8 points) and the Cochrane 

tool showed ‘some concerns’ in 16 and ‘high risk’ of 

bias in another 4 studies. But this was predominantly 

due to an unclear randomization process, which might 

also be a shortcoming in the composition of the papers. 

Furthermore, most of the meta-analysis conducted 

revealed a low level of heterogeneity, unlike in the two 

previous meta-analyses (42, 43).

This low heterogeneity reflects one of the major 

strengths of this paper. Due to the large number of RCTs 

identified, the categorizing of the rehabilitation protocols, 

and the rigorous methodology for the meta-analysis 

conducted, we were able to generate homogenous groups 

which could be analysed in the aggregate. The downside 

to this strict methodology was that only a few parameters 

could be analysed. It is an unfortunate limitation in 

orthopaedic research that there is a lack of standardization 

of study protocols. It would be advantageous if RCTs 

could be subject to clear guidelines with respect to 

outcome parameters, data analysis and presentation, and 

consistent with respect to the time points of post-operative 

evaluation. This standardization would significantly 

increase both the ability to conduct cumulative analysis

Conclusion

This systematic review and meta-analysis proved early 

functional rehabilitation protocols with early ankle M 

and WB following surgical repair of acute Achilles tendon 

ruptures to be safe. It appears these protocols may allow 

for a quicker RTW and RTS. Whether they also result in 

superior functional outcomes remains a matter of debate. 

Consequently, the previously postulated best evidence 

rehabilitation protocol for surgically treated Achilles 

tendon ruptures (14) remains the standard at our clinic.

Abstract

Background Displaced intraarticular calcaneal fractures (DIACFs) remain a complex challenge in orthopedic practice 

due to their complexity and the intricate nature of surgical interventions. While surgical techniques have evolved, 

postoperative rehabilitation is equally crucial for achieving optimal outcomes. This systematic review evaluates 

the effects of early weight bearing (EWB) in surgically treated patients with unilateral DIACFs on patient-reported 

outcomes, health-related quality of life, postoperative pain, differences in Böhler’s angle, and complication rates. 

Methods A systematic literature search was performed across PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library up to Janu￾ary 2025. Eligible studied included adults (≥18 years) who underwent surgery for unilateral DIACFs (Sanders type 

II–IV), implemented an EWB protocol, reported at least one patient-reported outcome, and were published from 2000 

onward. Data extraction and quality assessment were conducted using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale.

Results From 1007 identified records, 20 studies (n=1051 DIACFs) met the inclusion criteria. Pooled results showed 

a mean American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) Score of 85.7, Maryland Foot Score of 91.1, and visual 

analog score of 1.9. The analysis revealed a decline of 0.4 degrees in Böhler’s angle from postoperative to last follow￾up. The overall complication rate was 13.9%.

Conclusions EWB protocols appear to be safe and beneficial in the postoperative management of DIACFs, yield￾ing favorable outcomes without increased complication rates. These findings support the reconsideration of current 

conservative weight-bearing guidelines. Future research should focus on the development of standardized, evidence￾based after-treatment guidelines.

Introduction

The annual incidence of calcaneal fractures is approxi￾mately 11.5 per 100,000 patients and occurs 2.4 times 

more frequently in males than in females [1]. Operative 

treatment is often necessary, particularly in cases of dis￾placed intraarticular calcaneal fractures (DIACFs), which 

are generally classified by the Sanders classification as 

type II–IV [2]. Even after successful operative treat￾ment, prolonged aftertreatment is required, significantly 

impairing activities of daily living, quality of life, and 

socioeconomic factors [3, 4]. While anatomic surgical 

restoration may not completely prevent gait disturbances 

or persistent foot pain, it optimizes patient-reported out￾comes [5].

To improve patient-reported outcomes, new surgical 

techniques have been developed over time [6]. Minimally 

invasive techniques such as percutaneous screw fixation 

(PSF) have been proposed for DIACFs to reduce wound 

complication rates and improve overall outcomes [7–9]. 

The L-shaped extensile lateral approach (ELA) remains 

the most widely used method for open reduction and 

internal fixation (ORIF) of DIACFs [10], although the 

sinus tarsi approach (STA) is gaining popularity [11].

According to the Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Osteosyn￾thesefragen Principles of Fracture Management (‘AO 

guideline’, 2018), the current aftertreatment protocol for 

surgically treated trauma patients with DIACFs consists 

of non-weight bearing for up to 8–12  weeks, followed 

by partial weight bearing with a 25% increase in weight 

loading each week [12]. This has been the standard for 

decades, despite the well-documented positive effects of 

early weight bearing on fracture healing and maintenance 

of muscle and bone mass [13]. Furthermore, a recent 

radiological study demonstrated that early functional 

exercise and weight bearing can shape the subtalar joint 

and reduce the residual displacement of the articular sur￾face, thereby improving the functional recovery of the 

affected foot [14]. A recent survey among orthopedic and 

trauma surgeons on the opinions on non-weight bearing 

guidelines for the after treatment of calcaneal fractures 

showed that 96% of the responding surgeons interpret 

the current protocol flexibly [15]. This raises the question 

of whether the current guidelines are overly cautious, 

influenced by fears of secondary fracture dislocation or 

mechanical construction failure. 

Therefore, the aim of this systematic review and pooled 

analysis was to investigate the effectiveness of early 

weight bearing (EWB) in surgically treated patients with 

DIACFs on patient-reported outcomes, health-related 

quality of life, postoperative pain, differences in Böhler’s 

angle, and complications.

Methods

This systematic review was conducted and reported in 

accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Sys￾tematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guide￾lines [16, 17]. The review protocol was registered in the 

International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews 

(PROSPERO) [18].

Data sources and search strategy

A comprehensive electronic literature search was con￾ducted using the databases of PubMed, Embase, and the 

Cochrane Library up to January 2025. The search strategy 

included both free terms and Medical Subject Headings 

(MeSH) terms. Additionally, clinical queries were applied 

to retrieve targeted results pertinent to the diagnostic 

clinical question. No limits were imposed on the search 

itself. An overview of the database search strategies is 

presented in Table 1.

Two authors (C.V. and M.D.) supplemented the elec￾tronic database search by manually reviewing the refer￾ence lists of all selected articles to identify potentially 

relevant publications not previously identified.

Study selection

The search results were uploaded into Rayyan, a web 

and mobile app for systematic reviews, where dupli￾cates were removed [19]. Articles were then screened 

by title and abstract for possible inclusion. Two authors 

(C.V. and M.D.) independently completed this selection 

process and determined which articles to include. Disa￾greements between reviewers were resolved through 

discussion with the senior authors (EH/MP).

Studies meeting the following criteria were eligi￾ble for inclusion: (1) randomized controlled trials and 

cohort studies (either prospective or retrospective); 

(2) target population consisting of patients > 18  years 

of age who underwent surgery for a unilateral DIACF; 

(3) description of at least one patient-reported outcome 

measure among American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle 

Society (AOFAS) Ankle-Hindfoot Score [20], Maryland 

Foot Score (MFS) [21], Short Form-12/36 (SF-12/36) 

[22], visual analog score (VAS) [23], and complica￾tions; (4) description of an EWB regime (defined as any 

regime allowing a faster start of weight bearing than 

the AO guidelines); and (5) full-text clinical studies 

in English, German, French, or Dutch published from 

2000 onward. 

Studies were excluded if they met any of the following 

criteria: (1) fewer than 10 participants; (2) inadequate 

description of outcome measures; (3) results from non￾surgically treated patients; (4) cohorts containing only 

Sanders IV fractures; (5) studies including bilateral frac￾tures; and (6) editorials, opinion pieces, commentaries, 

letters, case studies, conference proceedings, system￾atic reviews, meta-analyses, narrative reviews, or animal 

studies.

Data extraction

Data extraction was performed independently by two 

authors (C.V. and M.D.) using a standardized extraction 

form. Extracted data included: (1) study characteristics 

(title, authors, year of publication, country, and conti￾nent); (2) methods (study design and number of partici￾pants); (3) patient characteristics (age and gender); (4) 

preoperative parameters [fracture type by Sanders classi￾fication, preoperative Böhler’s angle, and time-to-surgery 

(TTS)]; (5) perioperative parameters (type of surgery and 

operation time); (6) postoperative parameters (postop￾erative Böhler’s angle); (7) weight-bearing parameters 

(duration of non-weight bearing and time to full weight 

bearing); and (8) outcome measures (AOFAS, MFS, 

SF-12/36, all ranged 0–100; VAS, ranged 0–10; and com￾plications). Any discrepancies in data extraction were 

resolved through discussion or consultation with senior 

authors (E.H./M.P.).

Methodological quality assessment

The methodological quality of the included studies was 

assessed using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS) [24]. 

The NOS is a widely used tool in systematic reviews for 

assessing the quality and risk of bias in nonrandomized 

studies, particularly cohort and case–control studies. 

It provides a structured framework for evaluating the 

internal validity and methodological rigor of included 

studies, thereby aiding in the synthesis and interpreta￾tion of evidence. The scales uses a “star system” to judge 

articles in three broad perspectives: the selection of the 

study groups, the comparability of the groups, and the 

ascertainment of either the exposure or outcome of 

interest for case–control or cohort studies, respectively 

[25]. Studies were assigned in the following categories: 

“selection” and “outcome,” which lead to a star rating. 

The category “selection” assessed the studies on “rep￾resentatives of exposed cohort” and “ascertainment of 

exposure.” The category outcome assessed the studies 

on “assessment of outcome,” “follow-up adequate for 

outcomes to occur,” and “adequate follow-up of cohort.” 

Several criteria, such as “selection of the nonexposed 

cohort,” were deemed inapplicable. Therefore, the max￾imum adjusted rating in this review was five stars. Two 

authors (C.V. and M.D.) independently assessed the 

studies and gave an overall judgement in terms of “low,” 

“high,” or “unclear.” In case of discrepancies, the review￾ers reached a consensus during a discussion session.

A total of ten studies received a four-star rating; ten 

studies received a three-star rating. The detailed ratings 

are presented in Appendix 1.

Statistical analysis

All statistical analysis were performed using the meta 

package in R (Version 4.1.2; R Core Team 2023). A 

pooled meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the 

mean and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the 

AOFAS Score, MFS, and VAS based on n=19, n=3, 

and n=8 studies respectively. Pooled means were cal￾culated using the inverse-variance method, incorpo￾rating the mean and standard deviation (SD) from 

individual studies.

Due to high heterogeneity across studies, a random￾effects model was applied for subgroup analyses. Miss￾ing SD values were estimated using established methods, 

including the interquartile range (IQR) approach 

described by Wan et  al. [26]. If no IQR was available, 

mean imputation (MI) was employed.

Heterogeneity was quantified using the I

2

-index, with 

sensitivity analyses conduced to explore sources of 

variability. Additional analyses stratified by age groups 

(Appendix  2a), continent of the study (Appendix  2b), 

Page 4 of 12 Verstappen et al. Journal of Orthopaedics and Traumatology (2025) 26:43 

Sanders classification (Appendix  2c), and study design 

(Appendix 2d) are detailed in Appendix 2.

Possible publication bias was assessed via funnel plot 

(Appendix  3) inspection and Egger’s test, which yielded 

no significant asymmetry (p-value=0.900, α=0.05) [27].

Results

The initial electronic database search identified 1007 

potentially relevant articles, as shown in Table 1. Figure 1

illustrates the PRISMA flowchart of the selection process 

[16, 17]. Following the removal of duplicates, 862 articles 

were screened by title and abstract, with 612 excluded for 

irrelevance or failure to meet eligibility criteria. Full-text 

reviews of 250 articles led to the exclusion of 230 studies, 

resulting in the inclusion of 20 studies for analysis.

Table  2 presents the included studies, which repre￾sented a total of 1051 patients with unilateral DIACFs, 

with a median age of 44  years and 79.2% male partici￾pants. The mean TTS was 7  days (range 15  days).The 

mean operation time was 93 min (range 82 min). Study 

designs included randomized controlled trials (n=3), 

prospective cohort studies (n=3), and retrospective stud￾ies or case series (n=14). Surgical approaches included 

the extensile lateral approach (ELA, n=13), sinus tarsi 

approach (STA, n=11), and percutaneous screw fixation 

(PSF, n=1) [8–11].

Table 3 presents the fracture characteristics by Sanders 

and the distribution in percentages. The mean preopera￾tive Böhler’s angle was 6.2 degrees (range −1.5 to 17.3 

degrees). Direct postoperatively, the mean Böhler’s angle 

was 26.1 degrees (range 19.4 to 32.9 degrees). At the last 

follow-up, the mean Böhler’s angle was 25.7 degrees 

(range 18.6 to 35.1 degrees). The mean follow-up was 

22.6 months (range 6 to 49.2 months).

than the current AO guideline permits (8 to 12  weeks 

non-weight bearing). In three studies, a comparison of 

two after-treatment procedures was made [14, 42, 44]. 

Only the results from patients that followed early weight￾bearing protocols were included in this review. The 

detailed postoperative weight bearing regimes are shown 

in Table 4.

Patient‑reported outcomes

The patient-reported outcome, measured by the AOFAS 

Score, was described in 19 studies and 912 patients, and 

is shown in a forest plot in Fig. 2. The mean AOFAS Score 

was 85.7.

A total of three studies, with 81 patients, described the 

MFS. The mean MFS was 91.1 and is shown in a forest 

plot in Fig. 3.

In total, eight studies described the VAS in a total 

of 414 patients. The mean VAS was 1.9. The results are 

shown in a forest plot in Fig. 4.

Complications

A total of four studies were excluded from this table as 

the complications were not separately presented for the 

different after-treatment protocols [14, 42, 44, 46]. One 

study did not report mentioned complications and was 

therefore excluded from this analysis [38]. This resulted 

in a total of 16 studies presenting complications.

The rate of reoperations due to failure of osteosyn￾thesis ranged from 2.8% to 16.7%. The rate of wound 

necrosis (WN) ranged from 0% to 13.3%. The rate of 

superficial wound infections (SWI) ranged from 2.8% to 

22.3%. The occurrence of deep wound infections (DWI) 

ranged from 1.6% to 17.8%. The secondary arthrodesis 

ranged from 2.8% to 3.3%. Removal of osteosynthesis 

was not included in the total complication rate as it is 

a standard procedure in several countries (e.g., China), 

which could lead to distorted results.

Persistent pain (range: 5.6% to 42.4%) and nerve 

entrapment (range: 3% to 5.3%) were not considered for 

the total complication rate, as varying scales at different 

measurement times were used.

Summarizing, the median total percentage of compli￾cations (WN, SWI, DWI, reoperations due to failure of 

osteosynthesis, and secondary arthrodesis) was 13.9%.

In Table 5, the complications are shown.

Discussion

This systematic review and pooled analysis aimed to 

provide a comprehensive overview of existing literature 

concerning early weight-bearing protocols in DIACFs. 

The primary focus was to evaluate the impact of these 

protocols on patient-reported outcomes, complications, 

and radiographic parameters. The results showed mixed 

outcomes for patient-reported outcome measures: the 

AOFAS Score was 85.7, whereas the MFS was 91.1. Pain 

levels assessed by the VAS were 1.9. Subdivided into 

pre-, directly post-, and post-operative at last follow-up, 

Böhler’s angles were described. This study revealed that 

a low degree of collapse of the Böhler’s angle was shown 

in comparison to direct postoperatively to last follow-up, 

namely only 0.4 degree. 

However, complication rates are hard to compare with 

other literature owing to variation in definitions; the 

mean total complication rate was 13.9%.

The AOFAS Score is the most used patient-reported 

outcome in calcaneal studies and studies of the foot; 

therefore, it was used to measure the impact of weight￾bearing protocols on patient-reported outcome in 

patients with DIACFs [47, 48]. The pooled analysis dem￾onstrated an AOFAS Score of 85.7, which is higher com￾pared with recent literature in studies with patients who 

followed RWB after-treatment protocols (74.4–81.6) 

[49–51]. It suggests that EWB positively influences 

patient-reported outcomes, although there was a small 

difference in score. Hirschmüller et  al. [29] described a 

significantly reduced AOFAS Score compared with the 

other studies, which can probably be attributed to the 

high number of Sanders type IV fractures (20%) in that 

study. A systematic review of de Boer et al. [52] on both 

unilateral and bilateral DIACFs subdivided weight bear￾ing in surgically treated patients with DIACFs into three 

categories “very early,” “early,” “intermediate,” and “late,” 

instead of two in the current systematic review [52]. The 

AOFAS Score for the early group (n=4 studies) in the 

study of de Boer et  al. was slightly less compared with 

this study (82.4 versus 85.7).

The MFS is the second most frequently used score as it 

was only used in three of the studies, whereas the AOFAS 

Score was used in all of them; however, it is worth men￾tioning. The MFS is known as the second most cited out￾come score for DIACFs and was also used to assess the 

patient-reported outcome in patients with DIACFs [47]. 

The pooled analysis revealed that patients who adhered 

to an EWB protocol reached higher scores (91.1) in com￾parison with current literature [53–55]. To our knowl￾edge, there is no systematic review or pooled analysis

that compares the MFS for RWB versus EWB protocols 

in surgically treated DIACFs.

Pain levels were assessed by describing the VAS. This 

pooled analysis revealed that the VAS was very low, 

namely 1.9. This aligns with the findings related to the 

AOFAS Score, highlighting that EWB protocols not only 

enhance function but also contribute to pain reduction. 

This can potentially be attributed to reduced ankle stiff￾ness. Nevertheless, there was a large range in collection 

time of the VAS; therefore, the score should be inter￾preted with caution. No extra use of pain medication was 

described in the studies.

The Böhler’s angles were recorded preoperatively, post￾operatively, and at the final follow-up. Notably, in two 

studies, the Böhler’s angle measured immediately after 

surgery was lower than at the final follow-up [56, 57]. 

This study identified a significant correlation between 

the preoperative Böhler’s angle and the injury severity in 

DIACFs; however, only the postoperative Böhler’s angle 

showed a significant correlation with functional recovery 

[57].

A large variability in the described Böhler’s angles 

from the included studies was noticed. However, the 

known intra- and inter-observer variability for measur￾ing Böhler’s angles reached only a moderate (κ=0.55) 

level of agreement in a comparative study; the intrao￾bserver reliability reached a substantial (κ=0.77) level 

of agreement [58]. A more recent study showed that the 

AO-integral classification of injuries (ICI) classification 

system has levels of reproducibility similar to the Sand￾ers classification [59]. Therefore, it can be questioned if 

the big variation in Böhler’s angles can be attributed to 

this variability.

The main reason for delaying postoperative weight 

bearing on the affected limb is the fear of fracture col￾lapse. This study found a low degree of Böhler’s angle col￾lapse of only 0.4 degrees. Therefore, an intriguing finding 

emerged from the calculated Böhler’s angles subdivided 

by after-treatment group. This finding was not in line 

with the results of de Boer et al. [52] that found a decline 

in the “early” weight bearing group of 2.5 degrees.

Another important aspect of this study was the assess￾ment of complications associated with early weight 

bearing in DIACFs. Common complications included 

wound complications, hardware-related issues, and the 

occurrence of secondary arthrodesis [60]. These results 

emphasize that in the current practice the complication 

rate remains similar irrespective of the weight-bearing 

protocol. However, as complications rates are difficult 

to compare owing to differences in definitions, there is a 

need for the standardization of measuring complications.

Strengths

This recent systematic review and pooled analysis 

encompasses a substantial body of evidence, incorporat￾ing findings from 20 articles, and, in total, 1051 unilat￾eral DIACFs, making it the most extensive study to date 

on weight-bearing protocols in unilateral DIACFs. This 

inclusiveness enhances the study’s robustness and pro￾vides a comprehensive overview of existing literature on 

the subject.

The utilization of a pooled analysis allowed aggrega￾tion of data across multiple studies and offered a more 

statistically powerful and precise estimation of the over￾all effects of weight-bearing protocols. This method 

enhances the generalizability and reliability of the study’s 

conclusions, providing a more comprehensive under￾standing of the impact of weight bearing on DIACFs.

Additionally, this review assessed publication bias in 

two different ways: first, by visually inspecting the sym￾metry of the funnel plots, and second, by quantifying this 

score using the Egger test. Both techniques showed a low 

change of publication bias, indicating a low likelihood 

that the results could have been biased and that signifi￾cant positive findings are more likely to be published.

Limitations

Despite the valuable insights provided by this study, cer￾tain limitations should be acknowledged.

First, heterogeneity among the included studies was 

substantial and may have introduced bias into the 

pooled estimates. Although subgroup and sensitivity 

analyses were conducted to identify potential sources of 

heterogeneity, the observed variation could not be fully 

explained. Additionally, the methodological quality of the 

included studies varied, potentially affecting the overall 

strength and reliability of the conclusions.

Health-related quality of life outcomes measured by 

the SF-36 and SF-12 were excluded due to inconsistent 

reporting. Only a few studies provided the necessary

physical component summary (PCS) and mental com￾ponent summary (MCS) scores separately [61].

It should be noted that the actual fracture loading 

was not measured, making it unclear whether patients 

adhered to the postoperative protocols. Furthermore, 

none of the studies described crossover between the 

protocols. Specifically, a study by Kalmet et  al. con￾firmed this hypothesis, demonstrating no significant 

difference in loading between early and late weight 

bearing groups [62].

Follow-up duration varied widely between studies. This 

variability may influence outcome comparisons, particu￾larly when assessing complications and long-term func￾tional recovery. The results may have balanced out over 

time. A study with long-term follow-up of 20 years after 

surgery reported that 82% of the patients experienced a

clinical “steady state” at 14  months postoperative [63]. 

Moreover, a study by Kalmet et  al. showed a positive 

effect of early weight bearing in tibial plateau fractures in 

the first 6 months, after which functional outcomes lev￾eled out [62].

Moreover, the classification and reporting of complica￾tions lacked standardization across studies. As a result, 

several complications, such as nerve entrapment and 

persistent pain, were excluded from the pooled complica￾tion rate due to inconsistent definitions and assessment 

timing.

Finally, as more studies become available, future sys￾tematic reviews and meta-analyses may benefit from 

stratifying results by Sanders classification to determine 

whether early weight bearing is equally effective across 

different fracture types.

Future perspective

The suitability of the AOFAS Score as the preferred ques￾tionnaire for further research is questionable. Although 

the AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot Score is the most used ques￾tionnaire in DIACFs, it has not been proven to be ade￾quately valid, reliable, and responsive [64, 65]. A recent 

systematic review argued that the AOFAS Score should 

no longer be used in new research [48]. This underscores 

the need for a new questionnaire that is valid, reliable, 

and responsive for use in foot and ankle surgery.

Furthermore, to our knowledge, there are no rand￾omized controlled trials comparing the effectiveness and 

cost-effectiveness of EWB versus RWB. High-quality 

randomized controlled trials are needed to provide more 

robust standardized definitions, evidence, and guidance 

for clinical decision-making regarding weight-bearing 

protocols in DIACFs.

Conclusions

This systematic review and pooled analysis suggest that 

early weight-bearing protocols are associated with high 

patient-reported outcomes, reduced pain, and minimal 

Böhler’s angle collapse in surgically treated patients with 

DIACFs. Comparable complications rates between early 

weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing protocols were 

observed. However, these conclusions should be inter￾preted cautiously due to high heterogeneity.

The minimal improvement in clinical outcomes fur￾ther supports the need for well-structured randomized 

controlled trials to determine the optimal weight-bearing 

protocol in surgically treated patients with DIACFs.

Abstract: Background: This study aims to analyze the outcomes following the minimally

invasive surgery of calcaneal fractures using screw-only osteosynthesis, as well as the

impact of surgical timing. Methods: Between 2015 and 2020, 155 patients with 168 fractures

were included. According to the Sanders classification, 48.21% of fractures were classified

as Sanders 2, 33.33% as Sanders 3, and 10.11% as Sanders 4 fractures, with the remain￾ing fractures unclassified. A total of 117 cases were treated on the day of admission or

the following day. The surgeries followed a standardized protocol for fracture analysis,

positioning, and X-ray techniques, primarily using a percutaneous approach with stab

incisions. Osteosynthesis was mainly performed using screws, with five cases treated

with K-wires for open fractures. Results: The mean Boehler’s angle improved from 8.52◦

preoperatively to 25.00◦ postoperatively. Three superficial infections were observed. Deep

infections occurred in three cases, all following open fractures. Secondary dislocation was

noted in five patients—one due to a deep infection, and four attributed to clear technical

failures. One case involved a questionable indication for a screw change (7.3 mm screw)

after two weeks due to perforation of the medial wall. A total of 79 fractures were followed

up for an average of 4 years and 3 months. The mean AOFAS score was 91.3, and the mean

FAOS score was 88.7. Surgery within 7 days after admission showed no significant impact

on the outcomes. Conclusions: Minimally invasive screw-only osteosynthesis with early

surgical intervention offers favorable outcomes with minimal risk.

1. Introduction

Advancements in diagnostic means, innovative techniques, and specialized implants

have significantly enhanced surgical treatment options for calcaneal fractures and largely

replaced conservative therapies [1–5]. One of the key developments was the introduction

of the extended lateral approach combined with plate osteosynthesis, which emerged as

the ‘gold standard’ at the turn of the millennium, although it is associated with a risk of

soft-tissue complications [6–8].

Due to this disadvantage, minimally invasive treatment strategies have gained at￾tention as promising alternatives [9,10]. The most well-established technique features

J. Clin. Med. 2025, 14, 344 https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm14020344

J. Clin. Med. 2025, 14, 344 2 of 21

the sinus tarsi approach and osteosynthesis with specialized plates [11–15]. This method

notably reduces complication rates and achieves favorable reduction and clinical outcomes,

making it ideal for moderate fractures patterns (Sanders types 2 and 3). However, in the

case of comminuted fractures, it does not provide the same level of visualization to the

fracture situation and has limited options for reduction compared with the extended lateral

approach [16].

In addition, percutaneous procedures utilizing only stab incisions and no plates have

gained popularity because of their very low complication rates and the possibility of

immediate surgical intervention [17–19]. Some argue that achieving adequate reduction

is challenging, and osteosynthesis with screws alone may lack the stability required to

prevent secondary dislocation or to facilitate early fixation-free rehabilitation, but in our

study, we could not confirm these concerns.

The evolution of surgical techniques has also changed time management. While wait￾ing periods of 7 to 14 days are typically advised for the extended lateral approach [20], a

reduced time of 4 to 6 days for the sinus tarsi approach is common [21,22], with recommen￾dation to intervene even earlier for percutaneous techniques [9,23].

Our study focuses specifically on minimally invasive treatment techniques and screw￾only osteosynthesis due to its distinct advantages in reducing soft-tissue complications and

facilitating early surgical intervention. This technique eliminates the need for large incisions

or bulky hardware, which are often associated with postoperative wound complications.

Our results, in conjunction with a review of the literature, determine if this technique can

provide feasible outcomes compared to the ELA and the sinus tarsi approach and if it

allows for stabilization equivalent to established methods, such as plate osteosynthesis,

to enable secure bony healing and early functional rehabilitation, which is increasingly

recognized as crucial for optimizing clinical outcomes.

Another key focus of our study is the impact of the timing of surgery after admission

on clinical outcomes—an area that remains underexplored in the context of minimally

invasive techniques combined with screw-only osteosynthesis.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Data Base

The data for this retrospective study were collected at a local trauma center of the

Workers Compensation Board Austria (AUVA) in Linz, Austria, (Trauma Center Level 2).

The inclusion criteria encompassed all patients with surgically managed calcaneal fractures

between 2015 and 2020.

The demographic data (age, sex, and comorbidities,) and clinical parameters (fracture

classification, surgical techniques used, and length of hospital stay, etc.) were collected.

We recorded the time interval between injury and hospital admission at our facility,

as well as the date and time of surgery, to evaluate the timing of surgical intervention.

Postoperative complications, such as wound healing disturbances, infections, or the need

for secondary surgical interventions, were systematically extracted from the electronic

medical records.

All data were anonymized and stored in a secure database.

In the analyzed period, 155 patients with 168 surgically managed injuries were treated.

Including 2 reoperations, a total of 170 minimally invasive surgical procedures were per￾formed.

The fractures were grouped according to the Sanders [24] and Essex-Lopresti [25]

classifications. The majority of cases were Sanders’s type 2 (81 cases, 48.21%), followed by

Sanders’s type 3 (56 cases, 33.33%). According to the Essex-Lopresti system, there tended

J. Clin. Med. 2025, 14, 344 3 of 21

to be more depression-type fractures (87 cases, 51.78%) and fewer tongue-type fractures

(56 cases, 33.33%).

Open fractures were observed in 15 cases. Two of these patients had no additional

injuries. In all other cases, severe fractures to the spine, pelvis, chest, and extremities were

detected. According to the Sanders classification, there were two type 2A fractures, one

type 3AB fracture, eight type 4 fractures, and four fractures that could not be classified

(Table 1).

A total of 10 patients sustained polytraumas, all resulting from falls from height and

all with severe calcaneal fractures (12 fractures: 3 Sanders type 3AB, 9 Sanders type 4,

6 open fractures). A total of 13 patients (8.39%) sustained spinal fractures.

2.2. Time Management

The general time period from trauma to primary diagnosis was within 24 h in 152 cases.

One patient was presented to the hospital 4 days after the injury, another fracture was not

identified until 7 days later due to the absence of an initial X-ray, and a third was recognized

10 days post-injury due to a misdiagnosed primary X-ray examination.

Of the 152 patients, 135 were admitted to our facility within 24 h of the trauma,

and 16 within one week. The remaining 4 patients came between days 10 and 19 after

the trauma.

Following admission, 43 fractures were surgically treated on the same day, 74 the

following day, 30 between days 2 and 3, and an additional 16 had surgical intervention

between days 4 and 7. The decision to delay surgery for five patients by 10 days was

due to life-threatening injuries in three cases, all within the context of polytrauma. In one

case involving an 80-year-old patient, the treatment plan was switched from conservative

management to surgery 13 days after the injury. Another patient underwent surgery on the

11th day due to an initial incorrect diagnosis.

Patients without additional injuries or comorbidities requiring ongoing treatment

were discharged an average of 4.77 days after surgery, while the overall average length of

stay was 8.56 days (range: 1 to 90 days).

The number of surgeons performing the surgical procedures varied over time. On the

day of admission, 12 surgeons were involved; on day 1, 9 surgeons; on days 2 to 3 and 4 to

7, 5 surgeons. Later interventions were carried out by only one surgeon.

In Figure 1 the first column presents the absolute number of procedures on the day of

admission, 1 to 2 days after admission, 4 to 7 days after admission, and later. The other

4 columns show the percentage distribution of Sanders groups 2, 3, and 4, as well as the

unclassifiable fractures (Figure 1).

2.3. Statistical Analysis

All data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical methods to eval￾uate the outcomes across the surgical timing groups. Descriptive statistics, including the

means, medians, and standard deviations, were calculated for key variables, such as the

AOFAS and FAOS scores. Outlier data points were adjusted to minimize their influence on

the analysis.

To compare outcomes across the surgical timing groups, descriptive comparisons were

used to observe trends. While statistical tests for significance were not applied to the surgi￾cal timing groups due to the small sample size in some groups, the descriptive data showed

no clear trend, indicating a significant impact of surgical timing on functional outcomes.

The Sanders severity scoring system was applied to ensure that differences in fracture

severity were accounted for when analyzing the outcomes. This scoring system enabled

us to stratify patients by fracture complexity and assess whether severity influenced the

observed outcomes.

Given the limited sample size in certain timing categories, we acknowledge that the

study may not have sufficient power to detect subtle differences among groups.

2.4. Method

All patients were treated according to a comprehensive minimally invasive protocol

with minor adjustments based on the individual surgeon’s approach. The protocol encom￾passes standards for fracture analysis, classification, positioning, image-guided technology,

surgical technique, osteosynthesis, physiotherapy, and follow-up care. This approach has

evolved empirically since 2007. Due to the low complication rates observed in our previous

studies [26], surgical treatment was performed on nearly all patients, regardless of age,

comorbidities, or fracture type.

Surgical approaches consisted of stab incisions for 144 procedures, the sinus tarsi

approach for 16, a medial incision for 1, and various other approaches for 9 procedures,

primarily in cases of open fractures.

Fracture reduction was frequently facilitated by a specialized distraction tool (Froehlich

distractor [27,28]) in 100 cases. The Westhues technique [29–31] was used in 25 cases, and

the remaining fractures were reduced using raspatories, bone tampers, and pins.

To stabilize the length and axes, we used fully threaded screws with a diameter of

7.2 mm in 144 cases, usually using 2 of these screws (118 fractures). For sustentaculum,

tuber, or processus anterior screws, we used 4.00 mm lag screws. (137 fractures). In 5 cases,

K-wires were used alone, all of which were open fractures, and in 10 additional cases, the

screws were combined with K-wires. In 1 case, we used an external fixation, and 3 cases of

open fractures were treated only with surgical debridement.

The next picture shows the stab incisions for the distractor (red), for the reduction

maneuvers with a raspatory (black) and a pin (blue), and for the lateral (green) and dorsal

placements of the screws. The radiological outcome is presented as an overlaid X-ray

(Figure 2).

For the procedures, 7.3 mm full-threaded screws, 4.0 mm lag screws, and K-wires were

used. The overall number of procedures was 168 (excluding the 2 reoperations). Table 2

shows the number of specific screws and K-wires used for several fractures. For example,

we used two 7.3 mm screws in 118 cases (row 3, column 2). We did not use any screws for

9 fractures (row 1, column 4) (Table 2).

The average surgical time was 76.2 m. The durations ranged from less than 30 m for

14 procedures to around 4 h for 2 cases.

In the following example of a tongue-type fracture (Sanders group 2) the first surgical 

step was to correct the varus and then address the shortening of the dorso-lateral fragment 

through distraction. We always referred to the axial view on the CT examination, as short￾ening cannot be reliably assessed from the lateral view alone. In the central part of the 

image, we demonstrate the reduction of the tongue fragment using a Schanz screw in￾serted dorsally. On the right side, we present postoperative X-rays. Immediate fixation￾free functional treatment was initiated (Figure 3).

The last case is a patient with comminuted fractures on both sides combined with a 

lower leg fracture. The pilon fracture on the right side was reduced and stabilized using 

the standard open technique. The calcaneal fractures were treated percutaneously with 

stab incisions and screw-only osteosynthesis. The main goal was to restore height, length, 

and axes, while ensuring stable osteosynthesis. We also tried to achieve the most anatom￾ical reduction possible of the subtalar joint area. We never performed a primary ar￾throdesis and opted for fixation-free aftertreatment. A very good clinical result was 

achieved, supported by the highly motivated and athletic patient (Figure 5).

Next example presents a depression-type fracture (Sanders group 3). Again, we 

started with correcting the varus and shortening through distraction. Then, we lifted the 

dorso-lateral fragment dorsally with a pin, reduced the central fragment from the plantar 

side with a bone tamp, addressed the processus anterior, and inserted the guidewires for 

the screws. The surgical situation and examples of X-rays are shown in the center. On the 

right side, we present a radiological control image taken after surgery and a CT control 

taken 3 months later (Figure 4).

The last case is a patient with comminuted fractures on both sides combined with a 

lower leg fracture. The pilon fracture on the right side was reduced and stabilized using 

the standard open technique. The calcaneal fractures were treated percutaneously with 

stab incisions and screw-only osteosynthesis. The main goal was to restore height, length, 

and axes, while ensuring stable osteosynthesis. We also tried to achieve the most anatom￾ical reduction possible of the subtalar joint area. We never performed a primary ar￾throdesis and opted for fixation-free aftertreatment. A very good clinical result was 

achieved, supported by the highly motivated and athletic patient (Figure 5).

2.5. Postoperative Care 

A total of 99 patients were immobilized postoperatively with a plaster cast. Due to 

the increasing experience regarding the stability of screw osteosynthesis, there has been a 

significant trend toward fixation-free early functional treatment. 

This overview shows the number of fractures per year (green) and the decreasing 

number of fractures treated with a cast (orange) (Figure 6). 

Figure 6. Frequency of cast fixation in the years 2015 to 2020. 

The durations of immobilization varied: 13 patients were immobilized for 3 weeks, 

81 patients for up to 6 weeks, and 8 patients for longer than 6 weeks, with an average 

immobilization period of 37.28 days. While most of the surgeons used plaster casts in 

83.33% of cases, the surgeon with the most experience used it in only 38.28% for postop￾erative treatment. After 2019, the senior surgeon never used postoperative fixation and 

instead started early functional therapy the day after surgery. 

A mean of 74.2% of patients began partial weight-bearing at 6 weeks. Full weight￾bearing was achieved after 6 weeks in 15 cases, and 147 fractures (90.74% of 162 fractures, 

excluding 6 cases with no follow-up documentation) were fully weight-bearing by 12 

weeks. 

In order to ensure safe follow-up treatment, especially in the sensitive phase when 

progressing to full weight-bearing, CT scans were frequently used. This provided valua￾ble information about bony healing, the exact position of the screws, and any secondary 

changes in the reduction results. 

A total of 6 patients were discharged without reappointment because they went back 

to their home countries. Follow-up treatments were appointed for all other patients. For

3. Results 

There is no generally accepted scheme for evaluating the outcome and success of 

surgically treated calcaneal fractures. Commonly used parameters for assessment include 

the Boehler’s angle, subtalar step-offs or gaps, as well as the length, width, axis, and height 

of the calcaneus. From our understanding, only a CT examination is meaningful for the 

radiological results. 

3.1. Boehler’s Angle 

The Boehler’s angle improved from a mean of 8.52 degrees preoperatively to 25.00 

degrees postoperatively. 

The figure shows the changes in the Boehler’s angle from the preoperative situation 

(blue line) to the postoperative results (red line). The x-axis indicates the spectrum of the 

observed pre- and postoperative Boehler’s angles as degrees. The y-axis depicts the num￾ber of fractures (Figure 8).

3.2. Infections

A total of three superficial infections (1.76%) were detected. One patient, who had an

open fracture, was treated surgically on the day of admission, while the other two patients

underwent surgery the following day; one of them had a dislocation of a K-wire. All

infections resolved without long-term complications or consequences.

Deep infections occurred in three cases (1.76%), including two open fractures (Sanders

Type 4) and one case of direct trauma with open defects in the calcaneus.

Two of these patients received immediate treatment, while the third was treated the

following day.

One of these patients developed chronic osteomyelitis with initial intermittent

drainage but minimal symptoms. After five years, no further fistula formation was ob￾served, and the patient declined additional surgical intervention. The second patient, an

80-year-old woman with a local defect after direct trauma, developed a deep infection and

required partial amputation of the calcaneal tuberosity. The third patient, who sustained

Sanders Type 4 fractures bilaterally following a suicide attempt, was also undergoing

chemotherapy for cancer. This patient was treated with antibiotics alone without the need

for surgical intervention.

According to the data in the literature, the infection rate using the ELA ranges from 

13.3% to 31.2%, and the STA shows an overall percentage of infection of 3.6–6.3%. [32] 

3.3. Secondary Dislocations 

Secondary loss of reduction was observed in five cases. 

One patient sustained an open fracture that was stabilized exclusively using drill 

wires. Because of an infection one week after surgery, the pins had to be removed, and we 

saw a dislocation of the fragments. In the remaining four cases, technical filures were

One patient sustained an open fracture that was stabilized exclusively using drill wires.

Because of an infection one week after surgery, the pins had to be removed, and we saw a

dislocation of the fragments. In the remaining four cases, technical filures were identified,

including screws placed in the fracture gap and, in one case, intra-articular placement.

Three of these patients underwent surgery on the day of admission, one on the

following day, and one after six days due to a polytrauma situation.

3.4. Need for Secondary Operation

The need for an early secondary operation was detected in three patients. In one

case, a planned reoperation was performed four days after the initial K-wire fixation in a

polytraumatized patient in order to facilitate early functional treatment. In another case, a

7.2 mm screw was replaced two weeks postoperatively due to perforation of the medial

calcaneal wall.

Another early unplanned removal of K-wires occurred in one patient with deep infec￾tion.

One pin was removed without anesthesia 4 weeks postoperatively due to a dislocation

and perforation of the skin. In cases where K-wires were used, removal was planned after

bony healing—typically between the 7th and 12th week.

J. Clin. Med. 2025, 14, 344 11 of 21

The removal of 4.00 mm sustentaculum screws is avoided as much as possible, as

there is a risk of injuring the sural nerve due to local scarring.

The removal of larger screws (7.2 mm) is technically straightforward and can be

performed under local anesthesia, if requested by the patient. Occasionally, patients report

unsightly scars or pressure from footwear near the screw heads. In 25 cases, these screws

were removed after a mean of 6.8 months (range: 3 to 15 months). Some patients requested

screw removal despite no complaints. A total of another 30 cases underwent screw removal

after a mean duration of 11.88 months (range: 4 to 18 months).

3.5. Follow-Up and Scores

The functional outcomes, as measured by AOFAS and FAOS scores, were analyzed

across different Sander’s fracture classifications to assess the impact of fracture severity.

We successfully followed up with 73 patients who had a total of 79 fractures (6 patients

had bilateral fractures). The mean follow-up period was 4 years and 3 months (range:

1 year 11 months to 7 years 6 months). The mean age of the patients was 55.79 years at the

time of surgery.

A total of 40 patients (with 44 fractures) sustained additional injuries, and 30 patients

had fractures involving the same foot.

The mean AOFAS score for all cases was 91.08, while the mean FAOS was 88.66.

Patients with Sanders type 2 fractures achieved the highest average AOFAS scores

(mean: 93.83) and FAOS scores (mean: 91.84), followed by those with Sanders type 3 (mean:

89/84.43) and type 4 fractures (mean: 78/79.66).

The next table shows an overview of the results of the scores obtained, divided into

the main groups and subgroups. AOFAS = American Foot and Ankle Society Score;

FAOS = Foot and Ankle Outcome Score; number = number of fractures corresponding to

each category; max. = maximum; min. = minimum; Sanders = classified calcaneal fractures

according to the Sanders classification (Table 3).

3.6. Timing of Surgery and Scores

When analyzing with statistical methods (Winsorizing), the AOFAS/FAOS scores in

relation to the timing of surgery are as follows: 87.3/84.5 for the patients treated imme￾diately, 91.4/90.2 for those treated the following day, 93.5/90.6 for those treated on days

2 and 3, 93.4/89.8 for those treated between days 4 and 7, and five cases with scores of

89.8/83.5 for surgical treatment after 7 days (see Table 4).

Notably, the group treated on the day of admission included nine patients with open

fractures, and a high proportion of fractures not classified in the Sanders system, including

four “duckbill fractures”, requiring urgent surgery.

To better correlate the scores with the severity of the fractures in each group, a scoring

system was developed by the senior surgeon. Sanders type 2 fractures received one point,

type 3 fractures received two points, and type 4 fractures received three points. Fractures

that could not be classified within the Sanders system were assigned one point. An

additional point was awarded for open fractures. The total score was then divided by the

number of fractures in the group. We call this scoring system the “Sanders severity score”.

Table 4 shows all fractures for which an AOFAS/FAOS score could be determined

in relation to the time of surgery after admission to show whether the timing of surgery

had an influence on the clinical outcome. In order to compare the mean severity of

fractures per group, we defined a (Sanders) severity score, with lower values indicat￾ing lighter mean fracture patterns and higher values indicating greater severity. The

mean surgery time and mean Boehler’s improvement was also added. The day of ad￾mission = surgery on the same day as admission; one day = surgery in the first 24 h;

2–3 days = surgery after 2–3 days; 4–7 days = surgery between days 4 and 7;

>7 days = surgery after 7 days; AOFAS = American Foot AND Ankle Society Score;

FAOS = Foot and Ankle Outcome Score; Sanders = classified calcaneal fractures according

to the Sanders classification; SD = standard deviation; n.a. = not applicable (Table 4).

In order to apply the parametric analysis methods provided for this purpose, the

AOFAS and FAOS were first checked for outliers using box plots. The identified outliers

were limited to a minimum value of the 5th percentile or a maximum value of the 95th

percentile using Winsorizing.

4. Discussion

4.1. Timing of Surgery

The timing of surgery for calcaneal fractures remains controversial and depends on

various surgical techniques, like the ELA and a wide variety of different methods of MIS,

including STA.

Surgery using the ELA is usually not performed within the first 3 days after injury

due to concerns about soft-tissue complications.

Delaying surgery until adequate soft-tissue conditions are established was recom￾mended by Sanders (1992, 2014) [20,33]. Al-Mudhaffar (2014) [6] observed an increased risk

of complications when surgery was performed within 7 days of injury. Kai Wu (2014) [34]

found a 5.47% higher risk of incision complications when surgery was conducted within

3 days, recommending a delay of at least 7 days. Similarly, Zhang (2015) [35] noted in a

meta-analysis that surgery should not be performed within the first 3 days post-injury. De

Boer (2018) [36] also reported a higher risk of complications for patients who underwent

surgery within 2 days of trauma.

To define the ideal timing for surgery, several authors, including Sanders (1992),

Attinger (2001), Shuler 2001, Wei Zhang (2015), and Spierings (2020) [20,32,37,38] have

recommended waiting for the appearance of the “wrinkle sign”, which can be observed

typically between days 7 and 14 after injury.

Regarding the issue of how long one can wait to carry out the procedure, these authors

advise against delaying surgery beyond 3 weeks. This recommendation is supported

by Tennent (2001) [39], who observed an increased complication rate when surgery was

delayed beyond 14 days, and Kwon (2015) [40], who found that delayed operative fixation

did not reduce complication rates. Similarly, Jun SU (2017) [41] reported a higher incidence

of infections in patients who underwent surgery after an average of 14.2 days, compared

to those who were surgically treated after a mean of 11.2 days. Lei Shen (2022) [42] and

Spierings (2020) [36] also found that complications increased when surgery was delayed

beyond 11 days.

However, there are studies with differing conclusions. Backes (2013) [8] found no

significant impact of surgical timing on outcomes. Ho (2013) [7] compared patients operated

on within 3 days, after 3 to 10 days, and after more than 10 days and found no statistical

differences in infection rates, suggesting that early surgery can be beneficial. Similarly,

De Boer (2018) [35] found no significant difference in complications between surgeries

performed within 3 to 7 days and those delayed for 8 days or more.

In summary, most surgeries using the ELA are performed within 5 to 14 days after injury,

as noted by Sanders (1992), Howard (2003), Backes (2013), Kai Wu (2014), Wei Zhang (2015),

Amirul Islam (2020), Spierings (2020), LaRose (2022), and Lei Shen (2022) [20,33,34,36,42–46].

To minimize soft-tissue complications, there is a growing trend toward the use of

less invasive techniques, particularly the use of the sinus tarsi approach (STA). Its ability

to provide excellent visualization of the lateral joint area, along with a much smaller

incision, has contributed to a significant reduction in infection and complication rates, as

demonstrated by several studies comparing the STA with the ELA (Basile, 2023; Schepers,

2017; Mehta, 2018; Bandyopadhyay, 2023) [12,15,21,47,48].

Due to the lower surgical risk associated with the STA, there has also been a clear shift

toward earlier surgical intervention.

Basile (2023) [21] reported significantly shorter waiting times for the STA, and this

finding was also supported by Mehta (2018) [15] in his meta-analysis. Schepers (2017) [12]

found that surgery in the STA group occurred a median of 4 days earlier, with shorter

postoperative hospital stays. Amirul Islam (2020) [45] reported an average waiting time of

6.6 days for the STA compared to 9.8 days for open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF).

J. Clin. Med. 2025, 14, 344 14 of 21

Similar results have been observed by LaRose (2022), Bandyopadhyay (2022), and Syros

Alina (2022) [46,48,49].

In addition to a lower complication risk, there are technical reasons that make earlier

treatment appear preferable. Swords 2016 [50] mentioned that small incisions or sinus tarsi

approaches can be used for many calcaneus fractures, but reduction is less difficult when

performed early. The smaller incision provides a more limited view of the entire fracture,

making manipulation of the fragments more challenging as adhesions develop and bony

healing begins, particularly compared to the ELA.

Kwon (2015) [40] and Syros Alina (2022) [49] found that the time to surgery was the

only significant predictor of postoperative complications, with a higher rate of complica￾tions observed in surgeries performed after 14 days.

4.2. Screw-Only or Plate Osteosynthesis

For the sinus tarsi approach (STA), surgeons cannot use the large plates typically

associated with open surgery techniques, like the ELA. Instead, specialized smaller plates

are provided by companies. However, it is necessary to release the peroneal tendon sheaths

and surrounding soft tissues to ensure proper placement of the hardware.

As an alternative to plates, fractures can also be stabilized using a screw-only tech￾nique.

A biomechanical study by Smerek (2008) [51] demonstrated that percutaneous screw

fixation for Sanders type 2B calcaneus fractures provided strength comparable to that of

plating. DeWall (2010) [18] noted that the average loss of reduction at healing was not signif￾icantly different between screws and plates. Baoyou (2016) [52] showed in his meta-analysis

that cannulated screw fixation and plate fixation offered similar effectiveness in fracture

stabilization. Ivanov and Rodemund (2022) [53] tested various screw configurations, all of

which demonstrated good stability. Luo Gang (2022) [54] also confirmed the stability of

percutaneous screw fixation.

Some authors, such as Sato (2023) [55], reported less loss of Boehler’s angle in the

plate group, while Weng Q (2020) [30] noted enhanced stability with plates. However, both

studies found comparable clinical outcomes between screw and plate fixation. Lappalainen

(2024) [56] indicated that fracture reduction remained consistent with ORIF.

Despite ongoing debates regarding stability, all studies have reported comparable func￾tional outcomes and scores for plating versus screw fixation. Driessen (2021, 2022) [57] and

Zhiguo Chen (2022) [54] found no significant differences in the AOFAS scores between the

two techniques. Many authors, including Tornetta (2000), Baoyou (2016), van Hoeve (2016),

Hegde (2016), Gaul (2018), Philip (2019), Rodemund (2020), Wang Q (2021), Steelman (2021),

and Ebrahimpour (2021), [9,23,52,58–64] mostly recommend screw-only osteosynthesis for

all types of calcaneal fractures, especially for tongue-type fractures, due to its advantages

of reduction quality, time efficiency, and reduced risk of soft-tissue complications.

Our findings demonstrate that screw-only osteosynthesis provides sufficient stability

for the management of intraarticular calcaneal fractures, as reflected by the favorable

functional outcomes and low overall complication rates. However, we acknowledge that

secondary dislocations occurred in five cases, and this warrants further discussion.

A detailed analysis of these cases indicates that secondary dislocations were primarily

due to technical factors, such as improper screw placement.

To minimize such risks, meticulous attention to surgical technique is crucial. This

includes precise preoperative planning and the use of intraoperative imaging modalities,

such as fluoroscopy or intraoperative CT, to verify reduction quality and screw positioning.

Additionally, continued education and experience with minimally invasive techniques can

further reduce the incidence of technical errors.

J. Clin. Med. 2025, 14, 344 15 of 21

4.3. Percutaneous Reduction

Combining screw-only fixation and percutaneous reduction promises a very low risk

of postoperative soft-tissue problems, such as infection or wound edge necrosis.

The practice of reducing fractures without open surgery has a long history, with

reports dating back to 1855 (Clark, [65]) describing distraction techniques. A significant

advancement in fracture treatment came with the invention of X-rays in 1895, which allowed

fractures to be analyzed without direct visualization. C.W. Goff (1938) [66] provided a

comprehensive overview of 43 different methods dating back to 1906, some of which

involved covered techniques.

P. Essex-Lopresti (1951) [25] made significant advancements in the treatment of cal￾caneal fractures by developing a comprehensive understanding of fracture patterns, classify￾ing them into tongue-type and depression-type fractures. He also described a standardized

percutaneous reduction technique for tongue-type fractures based on the concepts of

Westhues (1934) [67], which remains highly effective today.

The development of precise CT imaging, including 3D reconstruction, has been cru￾cial for the thorough analysis of complex fractures and for meticulous surgical planning

(Lu et al., 2024; Misselyn, 2021; Galluzo, 2018 [68–70]). Modern intraoperative 3D scanning

now facilitates real-time evaluation and immediate correction during the surgical process

(Gwak, H.C., 2015 [71]).

Reduction without a direct view of the fracture is difficult but can be supported by

specialized tools. Most calcaneal fractures require the correction of axes and length, and

reduction can be supported following the principle of ligamentotaxis (Schepers 2009) [72].

Some surgeons have employed single-point techniques, such as those described by

Stulik (2006) [73] and Swords (2017) [50], while others have used specialized tools, such

as the two-point distractor designed by Peter Froehlich (1999) [28], as seen in studies by

Mattiassich (2017), Rodemund (2020), Batıbay (2020), Harrasser (2023), Li Xu-song (2023),

and Froehlich (1999) [23,26,28,74–76]. Additionally, the three-point distraction system,

described by Forgon and Zadravecz in 1983, was further explored by Driessen (2022) and

Schepers (2007) [57,77].

The percutaneous technique also influences surgical timing, with studies indicating

that the quality of fracture reduction improves significantly when surgery is performed

earlier (Chaniotakis 2023) [78]. In the study of Peng Ye (2019) [27], operations in the

closed reduction group were conducted within 1–3 days. Mattiassich and colleagues [26]

presented 212 fractures, of which 168 (79.2%) were surgically treated within the first day.

In our patient cohort, we predominantly employed stab incisions (144 cases) for frac￾ture reduction, followed by screw-only osteosynthesis. With proper fracture reduction and

careful, accurate screw placement, we consistently achieved stability during the postop￾erative period to avoid secondary dislocations and enable bony healing. Although the

earliest possible time of surgery is usually recommended for percutaneous techniques,

our results show that comparable results can also be achieved within the first 7 days after

admission. It is essential that all screws are correctly positioned, as demonstrated by four

cases of secondary dislocation. To ensure optimal screw placement and assess the reduction,

intraoperative CT imaging is recommended.

4.4. Additional Factors for Timing

In addition to medical indications for urgent surgery, such as certain fracture types

(e.g., duckbill fractures) or open fractures, the timing of surgical intervention depends

on various other factors. These include the presence of additional injuries, ranging from

frequent associated injuries of the spine or pelvis to polytrauma situations, which may

J. Clin. Med. 2025, 14, 344 16 of 21

necessitate delaying treatment of the calcaneal fractures to a later stage. Other factors

include comorbid conditions or anesthesiologic concerns.

The circumstances of the treating hospital also play a significant role. It is often not

feasible to mobilize the necessary personnel and organizational resources for a highly

specialized procedure within a short timeframe. Ultimately, a key consideration is whether

to proceed with early surgery or delay the intervention when a highly specialized foot and

ankle surgeon is not immediately available. Although there was no statistical significance,

according to Table 4, it can be seen that urgent and more severe fractures were treated on the

day of admission, “easier” cases were treated on days 1 to 3, and “more severe” fractures

were treated later. Several different surgeons were involved in the first few days. This

number decreased after a few days, as it became easier to book specialists in foot and ankle

surgery (day-of-admission procedures employed 12 different surgeons, procedures on days

4 to 7 employed five different surgeons). In this context, we consider it very important

that our results on the timing of surgery within 7 days show no significant differences in

clinical outcomes.

5. Limitations

A major limitation of this study is that we could not include plate osteosynthesis as a

comparable group to the screw-only or K-wire techniques.

We began in 2007 with the concept of minimally invasive therapy, inspired by the work

of Prof. Peter Froehlich from Hungary. Since then, we have incorporated various methods

and standardizations for positioning, X-ray views, reduction techniques, osteosynthesis,

and aftercare, all of which have been developed through cadaver workshops, literature

reviews, and the thorough documentation of all cases. Given our experience and low

infection rates, we chose not to alter our approach for the potential requirements of a study,

as doing so would have increased the treatment risk for patients under our care.

For the same reason, we did not have a randomized control group regarding the

timing of the surgery. Depending on the medical and organizational factors, surgery was

always performed as soon as possible.

Another limitation is the small number of patients available for the AOFAS/FAOS

assessment. Our hospital serves as a regional trauma center in an industrial town, treating

many patients referred from other hospitals and numerous industrial workers from abroad.

Additionally, polytrauma patients, in particular, were difficult to include, which is likely

to have lowered the overall AOFAS/FAOS scores. Consequently, the statistical results

regarding the timing of surgery and outcomes are limited, and we hope that future studies

will provide more precise verification or supplementation of these findings.

Regarding personnel resources, it is also important to note that the follow-up examina￾tions were conducted by a single surgeon, which introduces the potential risk of subjective

bias in the results.

We intentionally included all calcaneal fractures treated between 2015 and 2020 in the

study, without excluding any specific fracture types. This makes the group incongruent to

a certain extent, but also includes all requirements for the treatment of this type of fracture.

This study included both closed and open fractures, as well as peripheral, intra-articular,

and special types such as “duckbill fractures”. Our goal is to develop a general, minimally

invasive concept that applies to all fracture patterns, with standardized fracture analysis,

therapy-related classification, and treatment protocols.

To compare the “timing” groups regarding the different severities of fractures within

the groups, we designed an individual, unofficial scoring system and called it the “Sanders

severity score”.

J. Clin. Med. 2025, 14, 344 17 of 21

This study focused on two main topics: the timing of surgery and screw-only os￾teosynthesis. Many other factors influencing complication rates and outcomes, like fracture

severity, surgical techniques, age, aftercare etc., were not analyzed in depth or individually.

Including all of these issues would have expanded the extent of the study and detracted

from the clarity of its main focus. We will consider them in further studies.

6. Conclusions

The results of this study, along with the existing literature, demonstrate that minimally

invasive techniques promise good outcomes in the surgical treatment of calcaneal frac￾tures. Percutaneous techniques, which minimize additional iatrogenic soft-tissue trauma,

especially lead to very low complication rates. This approach allows for early surgical

intervention, not only in cases of severe swelling or beginning blister formations but also in

patients with comorbidities, advanced age, or heavy smoking habits. With correct position￾ing and dimensions, screw-only osteosynthesis provides sufficient stability to facilitate early

functional postoperative care and ensure safe bony healing without secondary dislocations.

This method also allows for much easier hardware removal in comparison to plate use if

necessary. The timing of surgery using these techniques shows no significant differences in

outcomes within the analyzed time period of 7 days.

Introduction: This study was conducted to identify the patient characteristics, classification, treatment,

complications, and functional outcomes of operatively treated displaced intra-articular calcaneal fractures

(DIACFs) in a level-I trauma center over a 20-year period.

Methods: Patients with a DIACF classified as Sanders ≥2 and operatively treated with percutaneous re￾duction and screw fixation (PSF) or open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) between 1998 and 2017

were identified. Pre- and postoperative radiological assessments were performed. Functional outcomes

were evaluated using the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) score and the Maryland

Foot Score (MFS). General health and patient satisfaction were assessed using the Short Form-36 Health

Survey (SF-36) and the visual analog scale (VAS).

Results: In total, 120 patients with a DIACF that were operatively treated with PSF or ORIF. Of these

patients, 72 with a total of 80 DIACFs completed the questionnaires (60%). The average follow-up was

130 months. Mean scores for PSF and ORIF were 74 and 75 for AOFAS, 78 and 78 for MFS, 68 and 61 for

SF–36, and 7.7 and 7.5 for VAS, respectively. An infection was the most common complication associated

with ORIF (31%), and hardware removal (58%) was the most common complication in patients treated

with PSF. Overall, 36 patients (68%) were able to return to work after a median time 6 months (IQR, 3–7)

and 6 months (IQR, 3,25–6,75) for PSF and ORIF treated, respectively

Conclusion: This long-term follow-up study reviews ORIF using ELA and PSF in the treatment of DIACFs.

This study shows that both treatments are capable of restoring the Böhler angle and yield relatively good

long-term functional outcomes. Differences in complication rates were apparent, infectious problems are

inherent to ORIF using ELA, and hardware removal is associated with PSF.

Introduction

Calcaneal fractures account for approximately 2% of all fractures

and have a significant impact on the daily activities and quality of

life of patients [1,2]. Consequently, calcaneal fractures have an ad￾verse socioeconomic impact given that approximately 20% of pa￾tients will not return to work within one year after injury [3].

The gold standard for the treatment of displaced intra-articular

calcaneal fractures (DIACFs) is open reduction and internal fixation

(ORIF) using the extended lateral approach (ELA). This procedure

is associated with a high rate of soft tissue and wound compli￾cations, particularly in patients who smoke or have diabetes [4–

6]. In recent years, minimally invasive percutaneous reduction and

screw fixation has become increasingly popular because the tech-

nique is associated with lower complication rates, shorter hospital

stays, and more rapid healing. However, minimally invasive proce￾dures involve limited exposure, making satisfactory closed reduc￾tion technically more demanding.

The minimally invasive technique of percutaneous reduction

and screw fixation (PSF) described by Forgon and Zadravecz

[7] was initially developed to reduce the wound complication rate.

The main criticism of this technique is the visibility of the poste￾rior facet, which prevents adequate reduction. However, evidence

that supports good functional outcomes in fractures treated by

minimally invasive percutaneous techniques is accumulating [8–

13]. There is only one study that directly compares the open ver￾sus minimally invasive percutaneous approach [14]. Although this

study concluded that percutaneous reduction and screw fixation

might provide equivalent reduction results and superior outcomes

for the length of stay, VAS scores, and complication rates for DI￾https://doi.org/10.1016/j.injury.2022.06.037

ACFs, the clinical value is restricted due to a relatively short follow￾up.

Both these techniques are practiced in our level-I university

trauma center for over 20 years. This study retrospectively reviews

the patient characteristics, computer tomography (CT), classifica￾tion, anatomical reduction, complications, and long-term functional

outcomes.

Methods

We selected all patients with a DIACF classified as Sanders ≥2

between January 1998 and December 2017 that were treated with

PSF or ORIF using the extended lateral approach (ELA) at our level￾I university trauma center in the Netherlands. For each participant,

the following information was included in the database: patient

demographics, mechanism of injury, fracture classification accord￾ing to Sanders et al. [15], comorbidities, pre- and postinjury sports

activities, and smoking habits.

The inclusion criteria for participant selection included pres￾ence of intra-articular calcaneal fractures classified as Sanders type

II to IV, age ≥ 18 years, and operation exclusively through PSF ac￾cording to Forgon and Zadravecz or ORIF using the ELA [7,13,16].

Exclusion criteria included fractures operated on by other oper￾ating techniques, open fractures, and insufficient understanding of

the Dutch language.

We classified the mechanism of injury into three groups:

(A) fall from height, (B) crush-type injuries, and (C) low-energy

trauma. To further classify the severity of the falls, the height from

which the individual fell was noted. Fall from height was defined

as patients falling from two meters or higher. Motor vehicle acci￾dents were the most common cause of crush-type injuries. The re￾maining mechanisms were classified as low-energy trauma, most

frequently concerning small jumps or falling down a staircase of

less than two meters in height.

All calcaneal fractures were classified according to Sanders clas￾sification measured on CT scans [15]. Pre- and postoperative mea￾surements of the Böhler angle were obtained on preoperative com￾puted tomography scans and compared with follow-up radiographs

[17].

Surgical treatment was performed by orthopedic and trauma

surgeons who were skilled in both PSF and ORIF. Whether patients

underwent PSF or ORIF was decided by the surgeon. For example,

if the tuberosity or the sustentaculum were comminuted, PSF was

not deemed feasible. The minimally invasive technique was per￾formed according to the modified Forgon and Zadravecz technique

described in detail in an earlier work by our group [13]. The open

procedure was performed using the ELA, which is similar to the

previously referenced technique [18].

An infectious complication was registered when oral antibiotics

needed to be administered, the patient required an intervention,

readmission, or intravenous antibiotics.

Postoperative management was equal for both surgical inter￾vention groups and complied with the AO guidelines [19] pertain￾ing to direct postoperative radiographs and six weeks of nonweight

bearing without cast immobilization and early exercising. Outpa￾tient follow-up with radiographic assessment was performed at six

weeks and then at three, six, and twelve months.

Functional outcome measurements

Patient-reported functional outcome, range of motion, and the

possible required changes in footwear, due to changes in foot size

or shape, were evaluated based on the American Orthopaedic Foot

& Ankle Society (AOFAS) score and the Maryland Foot Score (MFS)

questionnaires [20,21]. All questionnaires were sent and returned

between January and June 2019 with a minimum follow-up of 15

months and a maximum of 251 months. The AOFAS ankle-hindfoot

scale consists of subjective and objective variables classified into

three major categories: pain, function, and alignment. The MFS in￾cludes the same categories. The scores for both scales range from

0–100 with lower scores indicating more significant impairment.

For evaluation purposes, the AOFAS and MFS scores were classified

into four categories: a score between 90–100 was considered ex￾cellent; a score from 75–89 was considered good; a score from 50-

74 was considered fair; and a score of ≤50 points was considered

poor [20,21].

All patients completed a general health status form (SF-36) and

visual analog scale (VAS) for patient satisfaction that ranged from

0 to 10. On this scale, 0 indicates the worst possible result, and 10

indicates the best possible outcome. For the evaluation, the scores

were classified into four categories: a score of ≥9 was considered

excellent; a score of <9 and ≥8 was considered good; a score of

<8 and ≥6 was considered fair; and a score of <6 was consid￾ered poor. The SF-36 is a generic multipurpose health survey that

provides physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) health summary mea￾surements. This score ranges from 0–100 with higher scores rep￾resenting better outcomes [20,21]. One functional outcome score

per patient was used for analysis, even in the case of a bilateral

fracture.

Physical activity

All participants were asked to report whether they were ac￾tively involved in sports and, if so, what type of sports, before the

injury and after the revalidation process. These questions were not

validated but were intended to generate an overall impression of

the impact that different fractures and treatments have on partici￾pants’ engagement in sports.

The patients were also queried regarding shoe-related prob￾lems, work and sports activities at the time of the trauma, and

their return to work and sports after the revalidation process.

Ethical assessment

The results in this study were extracted from patients’ medi￾cal files and questionnaires. Informed consent was obtained from

all individual patients included in the study. The local ethical com￾mittee approved the study protocol (2018–4569).

Statistical methods

All questionnaires were digitalized into Castor, a web-based

EDC software used for data management that is completely com￾pliant with the principles of good clinical practice and all relevant

standards of data handling and protection [22]. Statistical analysis

was performed using SPSS version 25.0 statistical software [23].

Descriptive statistics were used for demographic data and injury

characteristics, including means and standard deviations and me￾dians and quartiles when appropriate.

Results

During the period between 1998 and 2017, a total 120 pa￾tient with DIACF operatively treated with PSF (n = 94) and ORIF

(n = 26) were eligible for inclusion. All eligible patients were asked

to complete the questionnaires, of which 60% did. These 72 pa￾tients had 81 calcaneal fractures. In total, 68 fractures were treated

with the minimally invasive percutaneous technique, and 13 were

treated using the open approach. The flow chart of the study pop￾ulation is illustrated in Fig. 1.

The patients’ characteristics and mechanisms of injury are listed

in Table 1. The population consisted of 55 males and 17 females

with a mean age of 46 years. The average follow-up was 10.3 years

for the PSF group and 13.2 years for the ORIF group. Twenty-three

patients were classified as Sanders type II, 39 as type III, and 19 as

type IV.

The most frequent trauma mechanism was a fall from height

(91.7%) followed by a crush injury (13.8%) and low-energy trauma

(5.5%). The mean time to surgery was 7.2 days, ranging from 1 to

22 days.

Mean pre- and postoperative Böhler angles are listed in Table 2.

Overall, the patients treated with ORIF had a worse average preop￾erative Böhler angle -5 (IQR, -10 - 5) than patients treated with

PSF 11 (IQR, 0–19). The postoperative Böhler angle was a median

respectively. The VAS for overall patient satisfaction was 7.7 (SD

1.6) in the PSF group and 7.5 (SD 2) in the ORIF group. The AOFAS

questionnaire of PSF-treated patients yielded good or excellent re￾sults in 53% and 60% of ORIF-treated patients, respectively. Patients

with Sanders type II fractures yielded the overall best functional

outcomes; both treatment groups yielded mean AOFAS and MFS

scores ranging between 86 and 89 and 78. One PSF-treated patient

did not complete all questions in the MFS questionnaire and was

not included.

Complications

Approximately 40% of the patients reported to require ortho￾pedic footwear. Yet, the most frequently reported complication in

the PSF group was soft tissue irritation while walking due to the

superficial positioning of the screws (Table 4). Therefore, in 39 of

68 (58%) patients treated with PSF, the screws were removed. In

3 PSF cases, screw removal was performed due to an infection. In

the ORIF group, osteosynthesis material was removed in 46% of the

cases, of which 24% were due to chronic pain. An infectious com￾plication was observed in 19 patients treated with PSF (28%) and

5 patients treated with ORIF (39%). Eight patients developed neu￾rological symptoms (dysesthesia or hypoesthesia), most likely as a

result of damage to the sural nerve. This complication was found

in 10% of patients treated with PSF and 8% of patients treated with

ORIF.

Physical activity

The walking distance and ankle stability results are shown in

Table 5. Sixty-eight patients reported their pre- and postinjury

sports activities. In the PSF group, 33% of previously inactive pa￾tients started to engage in sports after completing the revalidation

process. In the ORIF group, an equal number of previously active

patients had stopped or continued with their sports activities. No

one who was inactive prior to the accident became active after the

revalidation process was completed. In total, 77% and 69% of PSF￾and ORIF-treated patients, respectively, reported having no restric￾tions in walking one kilometer. Approximately 73% of PSF-treated

patients and 62% of ORIF-treated patients graded their ankle as sta￾ble. Overall, 36 patients (68%) were able to return to work. Median

time to return to work was 6 months (IQR, 3–7) for PSF-treated

and 6 months (IQR, 325–675) for those ORIF-treated patients.

Arthrodesis

Secondary arthrodesis was performed in 7 fractures in 6 pa￾tients, of which 4 were classified as Sanders type IV fractures.

All these patients developed severe osteoarthritis of the talocal￾caneal joint. Arthrodesis was performed in 10% and 8% of the pa￾tients treated with PSF and ORIF, respectively. In the arthrodesis

group, 71% fell from a height with an average height of 6.5 m.

Five patients were male, and the mean age at trauma was 41.5

years. The mean pre- and postoperative Böhler angles were -14

and 15º, respectively. Five patients were active smokers, of whom

three quit after operative treatment. These characteristics were not

significantly different from those of the group that did not re￾ceive arthrodesis. Two out of the 6 patients for which secondary

arthrodesis was performed had a Sanders type 4 fracture, were ac￾tive smokers at the time of trauma, were treated by PSF, and ex￾perienced an infection postoperatively.

Discussion

Open reduction and internal fixation are the current standard

procedures used in the treatment of DIACFs. The ability to directly

visualize the posterior facet, the presumed advantages of achiev￾ing a better restoration, and various anatomic parameters, includ￾ing length, width, height, and alignment, outweigh the increased

risk of complications. An increasing number of studies on mini￾mally invasive techniques show promising results; however, a long￾term comparative study is lacking. In our level-I university trauma

center, both treatments have been practiced for over 20 years. This

comprehensive long-term follow-up study presents the functional

outcomes and complications for both surgical interventions to be

reviewed and compared with other institutions around the globe.

Peng et al. were the first to study the differences in functional

outcomes and complications between PSF and ORIF in the short

term [14]. With a follow-up of 16 months, no significant differ￾ences in AOFAS scores were noted: 83.6 for PSF and 80.3 for ORIF.

Furthermore, a significantly shorter hospital length of stay was

noted in favor of the percutaneous fixation group at 6.7 days ver￾sus 9.6 days in the ORIF group. Although promising, the follow-up

period of one year was short for an assessment of actual functional

outcomes after rehabilitation and complications due to hardware

of posttraumatic subtalar arthritis.

Percutaneous reduction and screw fixation

Rammelt et al. reported a study on less severely displaced cal￾caneal fractures treated with PSF with an average follow-up time

of slightly greater than two years [8]. They reported an average

AOFAS score of 92 points without any postoperative wound com￾plications or infections. A 3-year follow-up study by Schepers et al.

reported an average AOFAS score of 83 points and an infectious

complications rate of 15% [11]. A study by Tomesen et al. an av￾erage AOFAS score of 84 points reported after a mean follow-up

time of 5.5 years with a postoperative wound infection rate of 13%

[12]. In a study by Weng et al., an AOFAS score of 87 points was

reported after an average follow-up time of 8 years with an overall

complication rate of 12.8% [24]. Finally, a long-term study from our

research group reported an AOFAS score of 76 points at an average

follow-up of 16 years posttrauma [13].

Open reduction and internal fixation

Studies on the long-term functional outcomes of ORIF using ELA

showed similar outcomes. Makki et al. reported an average AOFAS

score of 75 with an average follow-up of 10 years [25]. An aver￾age AOFAS score of 65 points with a follow-up of approximately

13 years was reported by Potter and Nunley [26]. Sanders et al. re￾ported an average AOFAS score of 75, an SF-36 PCS of 46, and an

SF-36 MCS of 55 after 20 years of follow-up [27]. Eckstein et al.

reported an average AOFAS score of 74 and an SF-36 PCS of 45 in

a study with a minimum of 20 years of follow-up [28].

Length of follow-up

Thus, the relationship between length of follow-up and the

overall reduction in functional outcomes is paramount. In our

study the follow-up was extensive, and the functional outcomes for

either the PSF and the ORIF treated DIAC were comparable with in￾ternational literature. One of the reasons for this reduction is the

inevitable process of posttraumatic arthritis, which has a evident

effect on long-term functional outcomes. The occurrence and ex￾pression of posttraumatic arthritis complaints are different for ev￾ery individual and depend on specific patient characteristics, frac￾ture type, and follow-up duration. This study graded the clinical

complaints rather than the radiological signs to determine whether

a patient was affected by posttraumatic arthritis.

Postoperative complications

Regarding the overall postoperative complication rate, as ex￾tensively reported in literature the PSF group had a significantly

lower infectious complication rate than the ORIF group mainly due

to wound healing complications. However, in our study, hardware

was often removed (62% in PSF vs. 46% ORIF).

Most commonly, the heads of the screws that are placed in the

tuber can protrude from the cortex of the tuber, resulting in soft

tissue irritation and discomfort when wearing shoes on the dorsal

side of the heel. These percentages are similar to those reported

by other authors. De Groot et al. reported that 19% of the im￾plants were removed in patients treated by ORIF at a follow-up of

6.5 years [29]. De Boer et al. reported a total removal rate of 35%

[30]. Among them, 66% were treated by PSF, and 39% were treated

with the ORIF technique. Furthermore, in a retrospective review,

Benirschke et al. recorded hardware removal in half of all PSF￾treated patients versus 39% in ORIF-treated patients [18]. Finally,

Dewall et al. recorded hardware removal in 12% of patients treated

with PSF versus 12% in those treated with ORIF [31]. An essential

aspect that one must keep in mind is that hardware removal after

the PSF procedure is not the same as that after ORIF. In contrast to

the incision needed for plate removal in ORIF, this is a relatively

straightforward surgical procedure for patients treated with PSF,

resulting in significantly less tissue damage with a subsequently

reduced risk of wound healing or infectious complications. Yet,

precautionary measures to reduce the incidence of this complica￾tion might be better. A supporting device such as a specific foot

ankle orthosis could offer some solace. Recently a heel-unloading

orthosis, allowing walking by shifting the load to the middle-foot

and forefoot was registered to be tested in a randomized con￾trolled trial [32]. Appropriately positioned and sufficiently counter￾sunk screws to may lower soft tissue complications and hardware

removal. There is convincing evidence that 3D fluoroscopy is an a

valuable addition to conventional intraoperative fluoroscopy in cal￾caneal fracture surgery [33]. A recent randomised controlled trial

on the effects of 3D fluoroscopy led to 56% intraoperative correc￾tions [34]. Yet, failed to find a beneficial effect of intraoperative

3D fluoroscopy in terms of radiological, patient-reported, or out￾come compared to conventional 2D fluoroscopy [34]. Nevertheless,

we question if a more optimal positioning of the screws acquired

with these fairly new techniques would lead to less screw protru￾sion into intra-articular surfaces or surrounding tendons.

Disabilities and sports

The results of our study suggest that patients treated with PSF

might have a positive association with the resumption of sports ac￾tivities. Approximately 50% of surgically treated patients who were

actively involved in sports resumed after rehabilitation. Among

them, 22 (69%) were treated by PSF, and 4 (50%) were treated by

ORIF. Of the 28 patients who were inactive prior to trauma, 8 (33%)

of PSF became active compared to none in the ORIF group. Al￾though the literature on return to sports is scarce, these numbers

seem consistent with the literature with approximately 54–76% of

patients returning to sports after rehabilitation [30,35]. Future ran￾domized research is needed to assess if minimally invasive surgery

of the calcaneus is indeed positively associated with the resump￾tion of sport activities.

Arthrodesis

The Sanders classification is an important prognostic factor re￾garding secondary surgeries, subtalar arthrodesis, and functional

outcomes in DIACFs [27,36,37]. Consistently, our study shows that

functional outcomes decreased with a higher Sanders classifica￾tion. Historically, primary subtalar arthrodesis has been indicated

for Sanders IV fractures as it might be preferable to avoid late

secondary subtalar fusion, which increases the cost and time lost

from work. In our long-term follow-up study, approximately 10% of

Sanders type IV fractures required secondary arthrodesis surgery

for both surgical interventions. Due to this low incidence, no anal￾ysis was performed on the difference in functional outcomes af￾ter secondary arthrodesis. A randomized multicenter trial showed

no difference in pain and function outcomes between open reduc￾tion and internal fixation with and without primary subtalar fu￾sion at the two-year follow-up in patients with a Sanders IV calca￾neus fracture [3]. Large prospective clinical studies are necessary to

determine whether type IV calcaneal fractures treated by primary

subtalar arthrodesis result in superior clinical outcomes compared

with those treated by ORIF or PSF.

Rehabilitation

Exploring new postoperative protocols could be valuable to fur￾ther improve functional outcomes or reduce socioeconomic costs

for patients with DIACFs. The standard AO protocol for the post￾operative management of intra-articular fractures of the lower ex￾tremities includes nonweight bearing for six to twelve weeks fol￾lowed by partial weight bearing with a weekly 25% increase in

weight-bearing [19]. For calcaneal fractures, an even stricter pro￾tocol is advised, namely, nonweight bearing for eight to twelve

weeks, which is not necessarily followed by a weekly increase in

weight-bearing [19]. Some studies show that mechanical stimuli

have positive effects on bone healing and maintaining muscle and

bone mass [38,39]. Recent studies on permissive weight-bearing

protocols show no increased secondary fracture displacement or

failure of mechanical construction. In contrast, no significant un￾favorable effects on patient-reported outcome measures, quality of

life, pain, or complication rates were reported [40–42]. A recent

systematic review concluded that any form of early weight-bearing

does not result in minor functional outcomes compared to the then

applicable standard AO protocol [19,43]. However, more prospec￾tive studies are needed to show if permissive weight-bearing pro￾tocols might impel patients to return to work and everyday life

faster, reducing the socioeconomic impact of the injury, especially

in calcaneal fractures.

Strengths and limitations

A strength of this retrospective cohort follow-up study is that

it is a single-center study performing both types of surgery and

where patients received the same high standards of care. Moreover,

patients were followed for 20 years. This study also has several

limitations. First, the ORIF sample size is relatively small, which

makes interpretation of percentages more difficult and compari￾son with the PSF group impossible. Due to the retrospective de￾sign, no randomization was performed even though no significant

differences in patient characteristics, fracture classification, associ￾ated injuries, or time to surgery were found. Second, a substantial

number of patients was lost to follow-up. These mostly concerned

migrant workers originating from East European countries with￾out a permanent residence, and whom mostly returned home be￾cause of the inability to work due to the sustained injury. Third, we

recorded a slightly disappointing response rate of approximately

60%, in retrospect this might be related to the number of ques￾tionnaires and the consequent time needed to complete. Reducing

the time to needed complete these validated questionnaires could

increase the response rate. Fourth, the data obtained in this study

mainly depend on information derived from medical records and

patient-reported outcome measures. No physical examination was

performed to assess functional outcomes.

Finally, the skewed distribution suggests that surgeons at our

center have a seeming preference for PSF according to Forgon.

As this might have favored their operative capabilities using the

preferred technique, direct comparison between the two operative

treatments is unfair. However, other influential factors that poten￾tially determined the choice of either treatment might be fracture

related. For example, a supportive lateral wall or an intact susten￾taculum cali is crucial for lateral reduction. Other critical factors

include the patients’ general health status and the local soft tissue

condition, which are all weighted in clinical decision-making.

Conclusion

This long-term follow-up study reviews ORIF using ELA and PSF

in the treatment of DIACFs. It shows that both treatments are capa￾ble of restoring the Böhler angle and yield similar long-term func￾tional outcomes, with worse results in higher Sanders classification

groups. Some differences in complication rates were apparent, in￾fectious problems are inherent to ORIF using ELA, and hardware

removal is associated with PSF.
